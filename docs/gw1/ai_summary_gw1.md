💀 **GW1 FPL Draft League: Career Endings, Bankruptcies, & Public Executions** 💀  

Some of you came into GW1 with swagger. Others? You came in like you accidentally submitted your kids’ Roblox squads. By the end of this week, reputations were destroyed, wallets emptied, and at least one manager (Kyle) should probably consider retirement.  

Let’s break it all down.  

⸻  

🏆 **Josiah “Football Thanos” Loh – 64 pts**  
Josiah didn’t just win — he committed fantasy war crimes. A 35-point massacre over Sean’s Gweepy has the league investigating if this was bullying. GF: 64, GA: 29, GD: +35 — that’s not a fantasy result, that’s a Bundesliga Bayern Munich scoreline.  

Everyone owes him a dollar. Eleven different Venmo requests. Eleven. This man just got paid to embarrass his friends. Imagine coughing up cash to the guy who just stomped you — tragic.  

thenotsospecialone? More like thenotsohumbleone, because Josiah is already unbearable and it’s only Week 1.  

⸻  

📉 **Kyle “Extended Foreplay” Herrera – 25 pts**  
Kyle’s team scored 25 points. That’s not a fantasy team, that’s an abandoned car on the M25. Losing 40–25 to Noah was bad enough, but finishing bottom of the league makes it historic.  

Extended Foreplay? Bro, your team didn’t even get to foreplay. They just fell asleep. Rename it to Eternal Abstinence.  

Oh, and look at this squad: Salah and… vibes? Delap? Havertz up top like it’s 2019? Timber (injured), Amad (benchwarmer), Hudson-Odoi (Sunday League All-Star). Kyle, this is basically a GoFundMe roster. Sell your team name rights for charity, you’ll make more than your points.  

⸻  

💸 **Sean “Gweepy” Dunn – 29 pts**  
Sean’s new name is 3 Points Delivery Service. Josiah put 64 on him without breaking a sweat. You conceded a +35 GD in one gameweek. That’s not fantasy football, that’s a FIFA rage quit.  

Your squad reads like a sick joke: Raya + Pickford in goal (two shot-stoppers, zero points), Tarkowski (Everton tax), James (injured since birth), Maddison (ghost of his knee ligaments). The only bright spot is Saka, but even he looked embarrassed to be associated with Gweepy.  

Honestly, change your logo to an Amazon Prime box. Everyone’s getting free deliveries from you this season.  

⸻  

🥈 **Chris “Schrödongers” Duncam – 60 pts**  
Chris quietly smashed Ronangel’s Atlético SeaSlug 60–38. That’s a +22 GD right out the gate. But let’s be real: it was against SeaSlug, aka the slime trail of the league. We’ll wait until you face someone competent before crowning you.  

Still, fair play. 60 points is big dog energy. Just don’t get comfortable — mid-table collapses are Schrödinger’s brand.  

⸻  

🥉 **Roy “This Year FC” Boateng – 51 pts**  
Roy clocked 51, beating Zryan’s FootAndBallFetish with ease. Solid. Respectable. But the real issue? Your team name. We’ve seen it. Every year. “This Year.” It’s never this year. It’s never next year. It’s never any year.  

By GW12, you’ll be rebranding to Next Year FC again, and everyone knows it.  

⸻  

**Harry “cunha believe it” Liu – 39 pts**  
Harry squeaked past Peter with a 39–31 win in the Cunha Derby. Congrats — you won the battle of who could be less mid.  

Let’s not pretend 39 points is good. It’s like being the tallest dwarf. Your midfield has Palmer, Mitoma, Gibbs-White, and some guys who sound like regens from Football Manager. Šeško up front at United? Bro, even Ten Hag doesn’t trust that.  

Yes, you got 3 points. No, nobody’s impressed.  

⸻  

**Andrew “Cunha Get Me Points” Smith – 42 pts**  
Andrew beat Don 42–38 in the snoozefest of the week. GF 42, GA 38. Congratulations, you survived a pillow fight.  

Your squad is basically Haaland and 14 guys nobody drafted on purpose. Strand Larsen? Minteh? Souček? This isn’t a fantasy team, this is a Europa Conference League qualifiers roster.  

⸻  

**Noah “Trophies Matter FC” Wilson – 40 pts**  
Noah handled Kyle like an adult playing against a toddler: 40–25. Respect. But 40 points with Virgil, Stones, Robertson, Garnacho, Watkins? That’s underachievement. Rename your squad to Participation Medals Matter.  

⸻  

**Ronangel “Atlético SeaSlug” Rojas – 38 pts**  
Your squad name is SeaSlug. You lost 60–38. The branding checks out. Slow, slimy, stepped on. Gakpo, Elanga, Grealish-at-Everton… I almost respect the chaos. Almost.  

SeaSlug isn’t competing this season. SeaSlug is just… existing.  

⸻  

**Zryan “FootAndBallFetish” Bhao – 35 pts**  
Zryan, let’s unpack this: your fetish is losing. 35 points. You lost by 16 to Roy. Your forwards? Ekitiké. Your mids? Cunha-at-United, Ndiaye, Iwobi. That’s not a fetish, that’s a crime against football.  

Change your name to FeetAndShame.  

⸻  

**Peter “Peattle Pounders” Henze – 31 pts**  
Lost to Harry’s cunha believe it. GF 31, GA 39. This squad is so weak you already rage-dropped Meslier and Onana for Perri and Estêvão. A teenage winger and a random goalkeeper. That’s not transfer business, that’s transfer clownery.  

Peter, the only thing you’re pounding is your own patience.  

⸻  

💳 **Outstanding Payments**  
Let’s add salt to the wound: everyone now owes Josiah $1 each. Watching 11 managers Venmo him like he’s their landlord is pure comedy. Some of you (Kyle, Sean, Peter) basically just paid Josiah to humiliate you.  

⸻  

📅 **Next Week Fixtures – Blood Incoming**  
• Harry (cunha believe it) vs Sean (Gweepy) – Battle of the Mid. Loser gets renamed *cunha believe you’re this bad*.

• Ronangel (SeaSlug) vs Zryan (FootAndBallFetish) – *El Clásico of Trash*.  
• Roy (This Year FC) vs Peter (Peattle Pounders) – Roy to collect another charity 3 points.  

⸻  

🎤 **Final Savage Verdict**  
• Josiah: Evil overlord. Unstoppable.  
• Chris: Vice president of pain.  
• Roy: Pretender-in-chief.  
• Harry/Andrew/Noah: Mid with benefits.  
• Don/Ronangel/Zryan: Lower-table mascots.  
• Peter/Sean/Kyle: Weekly punching bags. Just uninstall.
