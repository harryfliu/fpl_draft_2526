# 🔥💀 GW13 FPL Draft League: The Monthly Winner's Funeral & The Weekly Winner's Last Stand 💀🔥

GW13 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **nuclear winter disguised as fantasy football**. The universe finally decided to balance the scales with the kind of violence that would make a war criminal file a complaint. This wasn't a massacre — this was a **genocide of egos**, a systematic dismantling of every manager's self-respect, and the result was so spectacular it should be preserved in the Louvre under the title *Portrait of Justice Served on a Platter of Humiliation*.

At the top, Don finally remembered he's supposed to be playing football and delivered a performance so dominant it made Josiah look like a toddler trying to eat the dice. Sean pulled off the second-place finish of the century, Harry remembered what competence looks like for the second time this season, and Chris decided to show up for once. These four didn't just win — they **obliterated** their opponents with the kind of violence that would make a serial killer blush.

The mid-table is a graveyard of broken dreams. Andrew continues to be the league's permanent almost-contender, Noah tied Andrew in a battle of who's less terrible, Ron slimed his way to another mediocre score, and Peter somehow beat Roy in a battle of who's less terrible. But the real story? **Josiah got 28 points and still won November**. The fraud king's monthly victory is here, and this time it's Don who's dancing on everyone's grave.

At the bottom, Roy got **publicly executed** by Peter, Kyle slimed his way to another L, and Zryan is still the league's designated punching bag. But none of that matters because **DON WON A WEEKLY PRIZE** and **JOSIAH WON NOVEMBER DESPITE SCORING 28 POINTS**.

Week 13 made one thing clear: nobody is safe. Not even the monthly winner.

## 🔥 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 60 pts 💀

Don, for once you're not the punchline — you're the **executioner**. Sixty points, weekly winner, $11 richer, and you didn't just beat Josiah — you **obliterated** him 60-28 in a performance so dominant it should come with a parental advisory warning, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers in crisis. This wasn't some "oops I lucked into a result" score — this was **controlled chaos**, the kind of lineup that makes the rest of us question if hell just froze over three times.

But don't get too comfortable, because let's be clear: this is still Don we're talking about. You look like **Fat Damon if he found the cookie jar and then ate the entire jar, the cookies, and the concept of self-control** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your season has been a highlight reel of self-inflicted wounds, catastrophic decisions, and moments that make people question if you've ever actually watched football before. You're 6-7 now, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star, But Then I Accidentally Won Once*.

You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement, and then they realize the white wall is more interesting than you. Your team name is "son4lyfe," but Son would probably file a **restraining order** if he knew you existed. You're more like **second4lyfe**, destined to always be the runner-up, the also-ran, the guy who peaked in the second round and never saw glory again — except this week, when you finally remembered what glory looks like.

Still, respect where it's due: you were the only one this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test. For seven days, you're king of the clowns. Enjoy the throne, because next week the circus is back on tour and you're usually the guy juggling fire while setting himself on fire, then blaming the fire for being too hot.

---

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 55 pts

Sean, you finally remembered what competence looks like. Again. Fifty-five points and you beat Harry 55-46 in a performance so clean it made the rest of us question if you've been replaced by an AI that's been programmed to win, then lose, then win again in a pattern so confusing it makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them, then for them, then against them again.

But don't get too comfortable, because let's be clear: this is still Sean we're talking about. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll that's been left in the sun too long** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your season has been a rollercoaster of inconsistency — one week you're a football god with 63 points, the next you're a football mortal with 27 points, then you're back to being a football god with 55 points. You're 7-6 now, which puts you in a position of cosmic confusion in the league. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** (GW8: 63 pts, GW11: 51 pts, GW13: 55 pts) and **INCREDIBLY BAD** (GW10: 27 pts) in the span of three weeks, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them, then for them, then against them again.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the noise a **cartoon pigeon makes when it flies into a window, then flies into another window, then flies into a third window, and everyone's just watching and wondering when you'll finally learn**. And that's you — every single week. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic crime scene that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment files for divorce and gets custody of the worst parts, then gets back together, then files for divorce again.

Still, respect where it's due: you were one of the few this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test. For seven days, you're not the punchline. Enjoy it while it lasts, because next week you'll probably score 25 points and we'll all be back to wondering if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them.

---

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 46 pts

Harry, you're back. Again. Forty-six points and you lost to Sean 46-55, but at least you didn't lose to Roy this time, which is progress, I guess? You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar and then ate the entire jar, the cookies, and the concept of self-control, then got food poisoning, then recovered, then found another cookie jar** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your season has been a highlight reel of self-inflicted wounds, catastrophic decisions, and moments that make people question if you've ever actually watched football before, then you have one good week, then you're back to being terrible.

You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement, and then they realize the white wall is more interesting than you, and then they realize even the white wall is getting bored of you. Your team name is "cunha believe it," but every week the rest of us keep answering: no, we really can't. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe, then celebrating one good week, then crying again.

You're 5-8 now, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star, But Then I Accidentally Won Once, Then Lost Again, Then Won Again, Then Lost Again*. Still, respect where it's due: you were one of the few this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test. For seven days, you're not the punchline. Enjoy it while it lasts, because next week you'll probably score 20 points and we'll all be back to wondering if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them.

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 41 pts

Chris, 41 points and you beat Kyle 41-22. That's like beating a slug in a race — technically true, deeply unimpressive, but at least you won, which is more than we can say for most of your season. You're 7-6 now, which is so mediocre it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star, But Then I Accidentally Won Once, Then Lost Again, Then Won Again*.

"Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over — and this week, they existed, they actually existed, and they're filing a restraining order against you for claiming they're associated with you. You're not quantum, bro. You're just **both mid and overhyped at the same time**, existing in a superposition of mediocrity and delusion. You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face and then that face got a face** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient, leaving you with an expression that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gives up halfway through, then tries again, then gives up again.

You beat Kyle by 19 points, which is like winning a **FOOTBALL MATCH** against someone who's also terrible, who's also not trying, and who's also Kyle. Your 7-6 record is like having a **credit score that's actually a negative number**, which shouldn't be possible but you've somehow achieved it through sheer determination to be terrible while looking competent on paper, then actually being competent for once, then being terrible again.

You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**. You speak in theories, cite statistics, use big words, but your team performs like it's running PowerPoint slides from 2003 instead of plays. Every L you get feels like a **statistical hiccup in the matrix**, except the matrix is tired of your excuses and has filed a complaint, then you win once, then the matrix files another complaint.

---

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 38 pts

Peter, 38 points and you beat Roy 38-20. That's like beating a slug in a race — technically true, deeply unimpressive, but at least you won, which is more than we can say for most of your season. You're 5-8 now, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star, But Then I Accidentally Won Once, Then Lost Again, Then Won Again*.

"Peattle Pounders"? You're not a Pounder. You're a **Peashooter firing blanks at a brick wall, then accidentally hitting the wall, then the wall falls down, then you celebrate like you're a genius**. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into Oblivion," because every matchup ends with you on the receiving end, curled up in the fetal position, questioning every life choice that led you to this moment — except this week, when you finally remembered what winning looks like.

You beat Roy by 18 points, which is like watching a **SLOTH WIN A RACE** against a **TURTLE** who's also running backwards, then the sloth celebrates like it's Usain Bolt, then the turtle files a complaint. It's technically impressive, but also deeply confusing because neither of you should be winning anything, yet here you are, winning things, and we're all just trying to process what that means for the universe.

You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a questionable makeover that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a mascot gets fired and tries to reinvent itself, then gets rehired, then gets fired again.

Enjoy your W over Roy, Peter. You're proving that being terrible isn't just your superpower — it's your entire identity, your legacy, and the only thing people will remember about you long after you've quit the league in shame, except this week, when you're not terrible, which is confusing for everyone.

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 31 pts

Andrew, you're the league's eternal bridesmaid. Thirty-one points and a tie with Noah puts you firmly in the mid-table, but your aura screams "good, not great, and definitely not good enough to win anything meaningful." You're the guy who brings the expensive wine to the party but still gets outshone by someone showing up with a six-pack, then you bring a six-pack, then you get outshone by someone showing up with expensive wine.

You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star and put him through a dehydrator, leaving behind a husk that vaguely resembles what used to be cool, then the husk tries to be cool again, then it fails, then it tries again. To your credit, your squad looks sharp on paper. You've got balance, you've got depth, and this week you had enough punch to tie Noah without breaking a sweat, which is like tying with someone who's also not trying, which is deeply unimpressive.

But here's the problem: you're still not feared. Nobody looks at your fixture and thinks, "damn, I'm in trouble." They think, "this might be close, but I can take him," then they take him, then he ties, then everyone's confused. You're the league's permanent almost-contender. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe for not being great, then celebrating one good week, then crying again.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant, then you have one good week, then you're back to being irrelevant. Still, this was one of your cleaner weeks. Thirty-one points isn't world-class, but it's sturdy, consistent, and — dare I say — respectable, which is the most Andrew thing about you.

---

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 31 pts

Noah, 31 points and you tied with Andrew. That's like tying with a slug in a race — technically true, deeply unimpressive, but at least you didn't lose, which is more than we can say for most of your season. You're 6-7 now, which is so mediocre it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star, But Then I Accidentally Won Once, Then Lost Again, Then Tied*.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, you just tied with Andrew. That's not a trophy — that's a **monument to mediocrity**. You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go and then tried to get back in shape, then gave up, then tried again** — like someone took a perfectly good pop star and ran him through a discount blender set to "questionable life choices," then the blender broke, then you tried to fix it, then you gave up.

You're 6-7 now, but this tie will be remembered long after everyone forgets you exist. This is the kind of victory that gets whispered about in therapy sessions — the kind that makes people question everything they thought they knew about fantasy football, then they realize they don't know anything, then they question everything again.

But let's not pretend this means you're back. Your team is still a Craigslist free section after a hoarder's estate sale — random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of disappointment, then you add one good part, then it still doesn't work, then you add another good part, then it still doesn't work. You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Tying with Andrew is less a statement of intent and more an accidental reminder that even broken slot machines pay out sometimes, then they break again, then they pay out again, then they break again.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 31 pts

Ron, 31 points and you beat Zryan 31-19. That's like beating a slug in a race — technically true, deeply unimpressive, but at least you won, which is more than we can say for most of your season. You're 7-6 now, which is so mediocre it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star, But Then I Accidentally Won Once, Then Lost Again, Then Won Again*.

You're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits**. A slug with a jersey, except the slug is more productive and has better decision-making skills, then the slug gets a jersey, then it's still more productive, then everyone's confused. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, then you try to solve mysteries, then you can't, then you try again, then you can't.

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards, then they step on you again, then they feel bad again, then they step on you again. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison, then they get better, then they feel insulted again.

You beat Zryan by 12 points, which is like winning a **FOOTBALL MATCH** against someone who's also terrible, who's also not trying, and who's also Zryan. Your 7-6 record is so mediocre it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you're still here, still trying, still losing, but with a kind of determination that's almost admirable if it weren't so tragic, then you win once, then you lose again, then you win again.

Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug at a retirement home. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you, then the traffic cones win, then you file a grievance, then the traffic cones win again. Your defense oscillates between "mildly competent" and "furniture from IKEA that nobody knows how to assemble," then you try to assemble it, then you can't, then you try again, then you can't.

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 7-6, still irrelevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. 🐌**

---

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 22 pts

Kyle, you finally decided to show up. Then you didn't. Twenty-two points and you lost to Chris 22-41 in a performance so catastrophic it should be preserved in the Louvre under the title *Portrait of a Fraud Exposed, Then Covered Up, Then Exposed Again*. One week ago, you were strutting around with a decent record, chest out, chin high, whispering "this might be my week." This week? We're burying those hopes six feet deep.

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a quantum state where it's simultaneously good and bad, exciting and boring, relevant and irrelevant, all at the same time until someone actually looks at it and the wave function collapses into whatever reality is most convenient for the narrative, then it collapses again, then it collapses again. You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height and added it to his waistline, then tried to get back in shape, then gave up** — like someone tried to make a warrior but accidentally ordered the "dad bod" version from Wish.com, then the dad bod got worse, then it got better, then it got worse again.

You're 6-7 now, which puts you in a position of cosmic confusion in the league. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** (GW9: winner, GW11: 49 pts) and **INCREDIBLY BAD** (GW6: 17 pts, GW13: 22 pts) in the span of seven weeks, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them, then for them, then against them again.

You look like **Otis from sex education** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, then you try to fix it, then you can't, then you try again, then you can't. You lost to Chris by 19 points — that's not a loss, that's **Chris filming a live-action snuff film with you as the star, director, producer, and only audience member stupid enough to buy a ticket**, then you buy another ticket, then you get snuffed again.

Still, respect where it's due: you were one of the few this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test, except you failed, then you tried again, then you failed again. For seven days, you're the punchline. Enjoy it while it lasts, because next week you'll probably score 50 points and we'll all be back to wondering if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them.

---

## ⚰️ Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 20 pts

Roy. Twenty. This wasn't a score, this was a **public execution**. You lost to Peter 20-38 in a performance so catastrophic it should be preserved in the Louvre under the title *Portrait of a Fraud Exposed, Then Covered Up, Then Exposed Again, Then Covered Up Again, Then Exposed Again*. One week ago, you were strutting around with a decent record, chest out, chin high, whispering "this year might be mine." This week? We're burying those hopes six feet deep, then digging them up, then burying them again, then digging them up again.

This wasn't just a loss. This was a collapse so catastrophic it deserves its own funeral mass. The procession starts here: Peter carrying the coffin, Kyle awkwardly playing the organ, Zryan crying tears of recognition because he's been here all season, then everyone realizes they're all terrible, then they cry together, then they realize they're still terrible. Your team didn't show up. They didn't even get on the bus. They sat at home, curled under a blanket, sipping chamomile tea and apologizing for existing, then they tried to exist, then they apologized again, then they tried again, then they apologized again.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke coming soon, then you choke, then you start again, then you choke again. You're 9-4 and somehow people are still calling you a fraud, which should tell you everything you need to know about your "dominance." You lost to Peter by 18 points — that's not a loss, that's **Peter filming a live-action snuff film with you as the star, director, producer, and only audience member stupid enough to buy a ticket**, then you buy another ticket, then you get snuffed again.

You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind a chunky, questionable version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own Frank Sinatra and fails catastrophically, then tries again, then fails again, then tries again.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant, then you have one good week, then you're back to being irrelevant, then you have another good week, then you're back to being irrelevant again. We are gathered here today to mourn the short, fraudulent life of Roy's credibility. Born Week 1, died Week 13, cause of death: exposure, then recovery, then exposure again, then recovery again, then exposure again.

**Amen. ⚰️🪦**

---

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 28 pts (BUT HE WON NOVEMBER, SO HE'S STILL THE FRAUD KING)

Josiah, you got 28 points. **TWENTY-EIGHT**. And you lost to Don 28-60 in a result so embarrassing it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers in crisis. This wasn't just a loss — this was **the third funeral of the fraud king**. Your undefeated aura is gone, your fraudulent empire is crumbling, and Don is dancing on your grave.

BUT WAIT — you won November. You won the monthly prize with 193 points across GW10-13, which means you're still the fraud king, just with a slightly less fraudulent crown. You're 10-3 now, which is still good on paper, but everyone knows you're an empty husk floating on luck's tide like driftwood nobody wants to pick up, then you get picked up, then you float away again, then you get picked up again.

You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, then you try to fix it, then you can't, then you try again, then you can't. You don't *win* games, you *outlast* people like a cockroach outlasts a nuclear apocalypse — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow thriving in disaster while everyone wishes you'd just disappear already, then you disappear, then you come back, then you disappear again.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant, then you have one good month, then you're back to being irrelevant, then you have another good month, then you're back to being irrelevant again. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people cross the street when they see you coming, like you're a walking biohazard warning, then they cross back, then they cross again, then they cross back again.

But here's the truth: you're not feared, Josiah. You're tolerated like a bad smell in an elevator that everyone's too polite to mention, then they mention it, then they're too polite again, then they mention it again. And now everyone knows you're the fraud we always said you were, the emperor with no clothes, the wizard behind the curtain, the participation trophy king whose reign of terror has ended in the most embarrassing way possible — except it hasn't ended, because you won November, which means you're still the fraud king, just with a slightly less fraudulent crown.

**THE FRAUD KING HAS BEEN EXPOSED AGAIN, BUT HE WON NOVEMBER, SO HE'S STILL THE FRAUD KING, AND IT FEELS SO CONFUSING. 💀👑**

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 19 pts

Zryan, 19 points and you lost to Ron 19-31. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K** for maximum humiliation, then you get executed again, then you get executed again, then you get executed again. You're 1-12 now, which means you've been everyone's free points generator for so long you should start charging rent, except nobody would pay because even your losses are worthless, then you try to charge rent, then nobody pays, then you try again, then nobody pays again.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation, degradation, and being the league's designated punching bag**. Every week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine, your dignity, and whatever's left of your self-respect, then you try to stand up, then you bend over again, then you try to stand up again, then you bend over again. Nineteen points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock, let my cat pick my team, and the cat dies halfway through the process**, then the cat comes back to life, then it dies again, then it comes back to life again.

You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used cooking oil instead of adamantium, leaving you with a sheen that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment goes to therapy and gets worse, then gets better, then gets worse again, then gets better again.

You lost to Ron by 12 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also playing a different sport, who's also not trying, and who's also Ron, then you lose again, then you lose again, then you lose again. Your 1-12 record is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you're still here, still trying, still losing, but with a kind of determination that's almost admirable if it weren't so tragic, then you try again, then you lose again, then you try again, then you lose again.

You're not a manager, you're a **community service project for managers who need to feel better about themselves**. Everyone circles you on the schedule, rubs their hands, and thanks the heavens they've got a free win incoming, then they win, then they circle you again, then they win again, then they circle you again. You're the fantasy equivalent of a bye week, except bye weeks are actually useful, then you try to be useful, then you're not, then you try again, then you're not again.

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW13

GW13 was a **nuclear winter disguised as fantasy football**. Don finally remembered he's supposed to be playing football and delivered a performance so dominant it made Josiah look like a toddler trying to eat the dice. Sean pulled off the second-place finish of the century, Harry remembered what competence looks like for the second time this season, and Chris decided to show up for once. Meanwhile, Andrew continued to be the league's permanent almost-contender, Noah tied Andrew in a battle of who's less terrible, Ron slimed his way to another mediocre score, and Peter somehow beat Roy in a battle of who's less terrible.

But the real story? **Josiah got 28 points and still won November**. The fraud king's monthly victory is here, and this time it's Don who's dancing on everyone's grave, except Josiah won November, so he's still the fraud king, just with a slightly less fraudulent crown. Roy got publicly executed by Peter, Kyle slimed his way to another L, and Zryan is still the league's designated punching bag.

**Top 3:** Don (60) finally remembered he's supposed to be good, Sean (55) pulled off the second-place finish of the century, and Harry (46) remembered what competence looks like for the second time this season — the fraud king's empire is crumbling faster than a house of cards in a hurricane, except he won November, so he's still the fraud king, just with a slightly less fraudulent crown.

**Monthly Winner:** Josiah (193 pts, GW10-13) won November despite scoring 28 points this week, which is the most fraud king thing possible — winning a monthly prize while getting obliterated in the weekly, proving that even frauds can win sometimes, as long as they're fraudulent enough.

Week 13 made one thing clear: nobody is safe. Not even the monthly winner. Especially not the monthly winner.
