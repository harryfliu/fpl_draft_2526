# 💀 GW26 FPL Draft League: Harry's Redemption Arc & The Great Reshuffling 💀

GW26 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **cosmic realignment disguised as fantasy football**. The standings got tossed in a blender, hit frappe, and poured out onto the table in a mess so confusing it would make a quantum physicist weep. Harry — yes, **HARRY** — dropped sixty-one points like he suddenly remembered what sport he's playing, while half the league decided to cosplay as actual competent managers for once.

At the top, Harry finally escaped his own gravitational pull of failure and delivered a performance so nuclear it should come with a hazmat warning. Kyle remembered he's supposed to be good, Noah pulled off another solid week, and Josiah got absolutely **violated** by Harry in a beatdown so savage it belongs in a museum. Meanwhile, Sean beat Andrew in a rare upset, Don got demolished by Kyle, and Noah turned Ron into the human equivalent of expired yogurt.

The bottom feeders? Peter somehow beat Zryan in a battle of who can suck less air out of the room, Roy squeaked past Chris in the most mid matchup of all time, and everyone else just sort of... existed. But the real story? **Harry Liu is currently leading February**, which is like finding out your goldfish learned calculus — technically possible, deeply confusing, and you're not sure if you should be impressed or concerned.

Week 26 made one thing clear: this league is a dumpster fire, and we're all just arguing about who's burning the brightest.

## 🏆 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 61 pts

Harry. Sixty-one points. **SIXTY-ONE**. You didn't just win the week — you **detonated a tactical nuke** in the middle of the league and watched everyone scatter like cockroaches when the lights turn on. You beat Josiah 61-43 in a performance so dominant it should be studied by military strategists. You're leading February with 158 points through three weeks, which means you've somehow transformed from the league's designated disaster into... whatever this is.

But let's pump the brakes on your victory lap, because this is still **HARRY** we're talking about. You're 9-2-15, sitting in **LAST PLACE** with a goal difference of -126 that looks like a war crime statistic. You've spent the entire season as the league's designated ATM machine, handing out free wins like a broken vending machine that only dispenses sadness and regret. Your team name is "cunha believe it," and honestly? No, we **can't** believe it, because this is the same Harry who's been face-planting into oblivion for 25 straight weeks.

You look like **Matt Damon if he got lost in a Costco and never found his way out** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally broken about you. Your face has the expression of someone who just realized they left the oven on three days ago and the house is now a pile of ash. You've made more catastrophic decisions this season than a drunk person playing darts with a blindfold on, and your 9-2-15 record is so apocalyptically bad it looks like you're speedrunning a "How to Lose at Fantasy Football" tutorial.

But here's the thing: you scored **SIXTY-ONE POINTS**. You're leading the February race. You won $11 this week. For seven glorious days, you're not the punchline — you're the executioner. Is this sustainable? Absolutely not. Will you crash back to earth next week like a meteor made of failure and broken dreams? Almost certainly. But right now, in this moment, you're **king of the trash heap**, and that's gotta count for something.

Enjoy it while it lasts, Harry. Because we all know that gravity is undefeated, and you've spent the entire season proving that what goes up must come crashing down in the most embarrassing way possible.

## 🥈 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 53 pts

Kyle, you dropped fifty-three points and absolutely **obliterated** Don 53-42 in a performance that reminded everyone why you're occasionally dangerous. This wasn't some fluke — this was actual, legitimate football management, the kind that makes people respect you even if they don't want to admit it. You're 12-0-14 now, sitting mid-table with a goal difference of -77, which means you're the definition of "inconsistently decent."

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because watching your season is like waiting for something exciting to happen but it never quite gets there. You're Schrödinger's Manager — simultaneously competent and terrible until the gameweek ends, at which point you're just... there. You look like if **Khal Drogo got shrunk in the dryer and came out as a discount action figure** — like someone tried to make a warrior but accidentally hit the "compress" button and left you looking like a knockoff sold at a gas station.

Your season has been a masterclass in bipolar excellence: one week you're dropping 53 points and looking like a genius, the next week you'll probably score 19 and remind everyone why you're sitting in ninth place. You're the human embodiment of a slot machine — occasionally you hit the jackpot, but mostly you just take people's money and make sad noises. You look like **Otis from Sex Education if he gave up on therapy and started stress-eating** — technically a person, but something's fundamentally off about you.

Still, this was a clean week. Fifty-three points, a dominant win over Don, and proof that you're not completely hopeless. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** and **INCREDIBLY MEDIOCRE** in the same season, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually trying or if you're just a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone half-asses their way through fantasy football.

Keep it up, Kyle. You're the league's professional "almost-contender," and that's your entire identity. Own it.

## 🥉 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 50 pts

Noah, you dropped fifty points and **crushed** Ron 50-25 in a beatdown so savage it should be illegal in several states. This wasn't a win — this was a **public execution televised in IMAX** for maximum humiliation. Ron got turned into the human equivalent of expired milk, and you were the one pouring him down the drain. You're 14-1-11 now, sitting in fourth place, and you're proving that you're actually kind of decent when you're not busy being everyone's free points generator.

"Trophies Matter FC"? Bro, you just beat **Ron by 25 points**. That's not a trophy — that's a **participation award for showing up while your opponent forgot to wake up**. You look like **Bruno Mars if he let himself go and started eating feelings instead of hits** — like someone took a perfectly good pop star and ran him through a Costco bulk food section, leaving behind a puffy version that makes people question if you're actually the same person.

Your team is still a Craigslist free section after a hoarder's estate sale — random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of disappointment and broken dreams. But this week? This week you actually looked competent. Fifty points is respectable. Beating Ron by 25 is impressive (even if it's Ron). You're proving that you're not completely hopeless, just **mostly hopeless**, which is a significant upgrade from where you've been.

You look like **Pocahontas who discovered McDonald's and never looked back** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally wrong about the trajectory you're on. Still, this was a solid week. You beat Ron, you scored fifty points, and you reminded everyone that you're occasionally dangerous when the stars align and your opponents forget to field a team.

Keep it up, Noah. You're proving that even broken clocks are right twice a day, and today you're that clock.

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 43 pts

Josiah, you scored forty-three points and got **absolutely violated** by Harry 43-61 in a performance so embarrassing it should come with a trigger warning. This wasn't just a loss — this was a **public humiliation** at the hands of the league's designated disaster. You got beaten by **HARRY** — the same Harry who's 9-2-15, the same Harry who's spent the entire season as everyone's free points ATM, the same Harry who looks like he's never seen a football before in his life. And he dropped **sixty-one points** on your head like a tactical nuke.

You're still in first place at 16-0-10, but let's be clear: you're the **fraud king**, and everyone knows it. You look like **Post Malone's even more disappointing cousin, Post Alone** — like someone took a perfectly good musician and removed all the talent, leaving behind a husk that vaguely resembles success but smells like failure. You don't *win* games, you *survive* them like a cockroach survives a nuclear apocalypse — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow still thriving while everyone wishes you'd just disappear already.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who just realized the audience is booing** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. You look like you **smell like hot dog water that's been sitting in the sun for three days** — that weird, greasy, slightly-rancid smell that makes people instinctively hold their breath when you walk by, wondering if you're a biohazard or just naturally offensive.

You're not feared, Josiah. You're **tolerated** like a bad smell in an elevator that everyone's too polite to mention. You're the emperor with no clothes, the wizard behind the curtain, the participation trophy king whose reign is built on luck and the incompetence of others. And this week, Harry — **HARRY** — exposed you for the fraud you are.

Enjoy first place while it lasts, fraud king. Because the walls are closing in, and everyone can smell the desperation.

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 42 pts

Don, you scored forty-two points and got **demolished** by Kyle 42-53 in a loss so predictable it should come with a disclaimer. You're 10-1-15 now, sitting in eleventh place, which is the perfect metaphor for your entire existence: not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... there, floating in the void of mediocrity like a cosmic anomaly nobody knows how to deal with.

"son4lyfe"? Bro, Son would file a **restraining order** if he knew about this team. You're more like **eleventh4lyfe**, destined to be the eternal bridesmaid, the guy who shows up to the wedding but never catches the bouquet. You look like **Fat Damon** — like someone took a perfectly good actor and deep-fried him twice, leaving behind a greasy, puffy version that makes people question if you're the same species.

You lost to Kyle by 11 points, which is like losing a race to someone who's also running backwards but at least has the decency to pretend they're trying. Your 10-1-15 record is so painfully mediocre it looks like you're running an **experimental art piece** titled *What If Being Average Was a Personality Trait*, except nobody's impressed and everyone's just confused about why you keep showing up.

You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the **white wall behind you for some amusement** — like you're a visual sedative that makes people question if consciousness is worth maintaining. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's son who inherited all the awkward and none of the charm** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally off about you.

Enjoy your eleventh-place finish, Don. You're proving that mediocrity isn't just a phase — it's your entire identity, your legacy, and the only thing people will remember about you long after you've given up.

---

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 40 pts

Sean, you dropped forty points and beat Andrew 40-35 in a rare upset that made people question if the matrix glitched. This wasn't some dominant performance — this was a **technical victory** in a battle of who could be slightly less disappointing, and somehow you came out on top. You're 14-0-12 now, sitting in fifth place, which means you're still relevant but nobody's quite sure how.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the **noise a deflating balloon makes** when someone accidentally steps on it at a kid's birthday party — sad, anticlimactic, and vaguely embarrassing for everyone involved. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally plastic about you. Your season has been a rollercoaster of wild inconsistency: one week you're dropping 63 points and looking like a genius, the next you're scoring 27 and reminding everyone why you're the definition of "unreliable."

You beat Andrew, which is actually impressive since Andrew's usually competent. But let's not pretend this means you're back to form. Your team is still a Frankenstein's monster of random parts held together by duct tape and prayers. You look like you have **more DNA samples in your mouth than Ancestry.com's entire database** — like you're a walking genetic experiment that went horrifically wrong and nobody wants to talk about it.

You're 14-0-12, which is respectable but unspectacular. You're the league's professional "sometimes decent, usually not," and that's your entire brand. You look like a **cartoon pigeon that keeps flying into the same window** — Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. Every week, same result, different bruise.

Still, you beat Andrew. That's gotta count for something, even if it's just bragging rights in the mid-table mediocrity club.

---

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 35 pts

Andrew, you scored thirty-five points and lost to Sean 35-40 in a defeat that's somehow embarrassing despite being close. You're the league's **eternal bridesmaid** — always close, never quite there, perpetually stuck in the "almost" zone like a broken promise that never quite materializes. You're 14-2-10 now, sitting in third place, which means you're good on paper but everyone knows you're not winning anything.

"Cunha Get Me Points"? More like "Can-I-Get-Some-Respect" because nobody fears you, Andrew. You're the guy who brings the expensive wine to the party but still gets outshone by someone showing up with a six-pack and a smile. You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star and put him through a dehydrator, leaving behind a shriveled husk that vaguely resembles what used to be cool.

You lost to Sean, which is like losing a debate to someone who forgot what the topic was halfway through. Your team looks great in the spreadsheet — balanced, deep, competent — but when it comes time to perform, you're the **participation trophy king**. You're proving that you can be good without being great, which is the most Andrew thing about you.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they'll never headline** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you deserve respect, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you whining about how nobody appreciates competence anymore.

You're 14-2-10, third place, and somehow still not feared. That's your legacy, Andrew. Almost-great, never-feared, perpetually-second-tier.

---

## 💀 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 35 pts

Roy, you scored thirty-five points and squeaked past Chris 35-31 in the most **aggressively mediocre matchup** of the week. This wasn't a win — this was two people drowning in mediocrity and you just happened to drown slower. You're 13-0-13 now, sitting in sixth place with a goal difference of -94, which means you're the definition of "perfectly average in the most disappointing way possible."

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're like Arsenal on life support: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable collapse scheduled for delivery. You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind a chunky, questionable version that makes people wonder if you're actually edible or just decorative.

You beat Chris by four points, which is like winning a race against someone who's also crawling but at least you crawled slightly faster. Your 13-0-13 record is the most mid thing about you — perfectly balanced, completely unremarkable, the statistical equivalent of lukewarm tap water. You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize the glory days are behind him** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant.

You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you deserve respect, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying about how the universe is against you. You're not feared, Roy. You're **tolerated** like elevator music — present, technically functional, but nobody's actually enjoying the experience.

Enjoy your mid-table mediocrity, Roy. It's where you belong, and it's where you'll stay.

---

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 34 pts

Peter, you scored thirty-four points and beat Zryan 34-28 in a battle of who could suck less oxygen out of the room. That's like winning a race against someone who's also running in quicksand — technically true, deeply unimpressive. You're 15-0-11 now, sitting in **SECOND PLACE**, which is the most shocking thing about this entire gameweek because nobody expected you to be anywhere near the top half of anything.

"Peattle Pounders"? You're not a Pounder. You're a **Peashooter firing blanks at a brick wall** while apologizing for the noise. You look like if **hepatitis C was a person who started a podcast** — like a walking medical warning label that somehow convinced people to listen to it talk about fantasy football. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into Submission," because every week feels like you're one bad decision away from total collapse.

You beat Zryan by 6 points, which is like watching a **SNAIL WIN A RACE** against a **TURTLE WHO FORGOT HE WAS RACING**. It's technically impressive, but also deeply confusing because neither of you should be winning anything, yet here you are, winning things, and we're all just trying to process what that means for the universe. You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a questionable makeover that makes people uncomfortable.

You're in second place with 45 league points, which means you've somehow stumbled your way into contention despite looking like you've never seen a football before. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people cross the street when they see you coming.

Enjoy second place, Peter. You're proving that sometimes being terrible in a competent way is better than being competent in a terrible way, and that's the most Peter thing about you.

---

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 31 pts

Chris, you scored thirty-one points and lost to Roy 31-35 in the most **aggressively mid** matchup of the week. This wasn't a loss — this was two people arguing about who's less terrible and you lost the argument. You're 12-0-14 now, sitting in eighth place, which is the perfect metaphor for your entire existence: not bad enough to be memorable, not good enough to be respected, just... there.

"Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over — and this week, they barely existed, they're filing for bankruptcy, and they're blaming you for their financial ruin. You're not quantum, bro. You're just **both mid and delusional at the same time**, existing in a superposition of mediocrity and false confidence. You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face and then that face gave up on life** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient and apathy as the finishing touch.

You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam if he never grew up** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally arrested about your development. You lost to Roy by 4 points, which is like losing a debate to someone who forgot what words mean halfway through. Your 12-0-14 record is so painfully mediocre it looks like you're running an **experimental art piece** titled *What If Being Forgettable Was a Superpower*, except nobody remembers you long enough to appreciate the irony.

You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**. You speak in theories, cite statistics, use big words, but your team performs like it's running on Windows 95. You look like you must have been an **auctioneer in your past life** and you're spending this lifetime repenting for talking too fast and saying too little.

Enjoy eighth place, Chris. You're the league's professional "technically here," and that's your entire legacy.

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 28 pts

Zryan, you scored twenty-eight points and lost to Peter 28-34. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 8K HDR** for maximum humiliation. You're 11-0-15 now, sitting in tenth place, which means you've somehow escaped last place but you're still everyone's favorite punching bag. You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin and disappointment** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used failure as the main ingredient.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation, degradation, and being the league's designated victim**. Every week you show up, get absolutely demolished, and then come back for more like you're in an abusive relationship with fantasy football itself. Twenty-eight points is what I get when I **let my goldfish pick my team** and the goldfish dies halfway through the process.

You lost to Peter by 6 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also playing blindfolded, who's also never seen a football, and who's also Peter. Your 11-0-15 record is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Losing Was My Brand*, except nobody's buying what you're selling because it's worthless.

You look like you have **more DNA samples in your mouth than Ancestry.com's entire vault** — like you're a walking genetic crime scene that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets drunk and makes terrible decisions. You're not a manager, you're a **community service project** for managers who need to feel better about themselves.

Enjoy tenth place, Zryan. You're proving that even when you escape the basement, you're still living in the crawl space, and that's the most you'll ever achieve.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 25 pts

Ron, you scored **twenty-five points** and got absolutely **obliterated** by Noah 25-50 in a beatdown so savage it should be preserved in a museum under the title *Portrait of a Man Who Gave Up*. This wasn't just a loss — this was a **public execution televised in IMAX 3D** for maximum humiliation. You're 12-2-12 now, sitting in seventh place, and you're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits**.

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley who gave up on solving mysteries** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally wrong about your entire vibe. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison and demand a refund.

You lost to Noah by **TWENTY-FIVE POINTS**, which is like losing a race to someone who's also crawling but at least they're crawling with purpose. Twenty-five points is what I get when I **forget fantasy football exists, remember it three days late, and let autocorrect pick my team**. You look like you have **more DNA samples in your mouth than Ancestry.com's entire database** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a petri dish gains sentience and starts playing fantasy football.

Your attack is about as threatening as a **group hug at a retirement home**. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you. Your defense oscillates between "mildly incompetent" and "furniture from IKEA that nobody knows how to assemble and doesn't want to admit they've given up on."

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 12-2-12, seventh place, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. 🐌**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW26

GW26 was a **cosmic realignment disguised as fantasy football**. Harry finally remembered he's supposed to be playing a sport and delivered a nuclear performance that reminded everyone he's capable of competence when the stars align and the universe stops actively working against him. Kyle demolished Don with authority, Noah turned Ron into expired dairy products, and Sean pulled off a rare upset over Andrew that made people question if the simulation glitched.

Meanwhile, Josiah got absolutely **violated** by Harry in a beatdown so savage it belongs in a museum, Peter somehow beat Zryan in a battle of who could suck less, and Roy squeaked past Chris in the most mid matchup of all time. The standings are a mess, the February race is heating up, and Harry — yes, **HARRY** — is currently leading the monthly competition, which is like finding out your goldfish learned calculus.

**Top 3:** Harry (61) finally escaped his gravitational pull of failure, Kyle (53) reminded everyone he's occasionally dangerous, and Noah (50) turned Ron into the human equivalent of spoiled milk.

**The Fraud Watch:** Josiah still sits in first place at 16-0-10, but everyone knows the emperor has no clothes. Peter somehow clawed his way to second place at 15-0-11, proving that sometimes being terrible in a consistent way beats being inconsistently decent. Andrew rounds out the top three, forever the bridesmaid, never the bride.

Week 26 made one thing clear: this league is chaos incarnate, and we're all just passengers on a train that's actively derailing in slow motion. Nobody is safe. Not even the fraud king.
