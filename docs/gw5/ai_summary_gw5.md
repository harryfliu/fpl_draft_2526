# 💀 GW5 FPL Draft League: False Prophets, Lucky Survivors, & Roy’s Funeral 💀

GW5 wasn’t just another week in fantasy football — it was a **Greek tragedy performed by clowns**. Every manager walked onto the stage convinced they were destined for glory, only to be exposed under the harsh spotlight of reality. Some strutted, some stumbled, and one (hi Roy) face-planted so catastrophically it should be preserved in the Louvre under the title *Portrait of a Fraud.*

At the top of the chaos, Don — yes, **Don** — actually looked like a manager instead of a toddler trying to eat the dice. Chris remembered what points are and Andrew once again flirted with greatness, the footballing embodiment of “close but not quite.” These three stood out not because they were brilliant, but because the rest of you were so unbelievably bad.

The mid-table is filling with pretenders who talk a big game but deliver the scoring equivalent of soggy toast. Josiah is still unbeaten, but his aura is more “guy who dodged a bar fight” than “league titan.” Kyle is Extended Foreplay personified — all tease, no climax. Sean is surviving on vibes, Harry is building a highlight reel of humiliation, and Ron continues to redefine what it means to be a slug.

At the bottom, Noah and Peter are in a tight race for “most useless NPC,” and Zryan — congrats, you finally won, but it came against Noah, which is like celebrating a dunk on a six-foot rim.

Week 5 made one thing clear: this league isn’t about who’s elite. It’s about who can avoid being immortalized in roast history for one more week.

## 🏆 Don “son4lyfe” Kim — 44 pts
Don, for once you’re not the punchline — you’re the headline. Forty-four points, weekly winner, $11 richer. For a single glorious gameweek, you actually looked like the manager your team name pretends you’ve been all along. This wasn’t some “oops I lucked into a result” score — this was controlled chaos, the kind of lineup that makes the rest of us double-check if hell just froze over.

But don’t get too comfortable, because let’s be clear: this is still Don we’re talking about. Your squad is a time bomb duct-taped together by vibes and misplaced faith in Tottenham attackers. You’re as likely to follow this up with a 12-point stinker as you are to repeat it. Still, respect where it’s due: you were the only one this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test.

For seven days, you’re king of the clowns. Enjoy the throne, because next week the circus is back on tour and you’re usually the guy juggling fire while setting himself on fire.

## 💀 Chris “Schrödongers” Duncam — 43 pts
Chris, you finally decided to remember what fantasy football is. Forty-three points, second-best of the week, and a win over Harry that was so decisive it should’ve come with a parental advisory warning. This is the Schrödongers paradox in action: sometimes your team exists as an actual squad, sometimes it collapses into a quantum vacuum. GW5, they showed up.

And credit where it’s due: when your side clicks, it clicks loud. The attack was sharp, your choices were clean, and for once you didn’t leave half your points rotting on the bench like forgotten groceries. That’s competence, Chris. Actual competence.

But don’t get it twisted — you’re still two bad fixtures away from posting the kind of score that gets whispered about in therapy sessions. Schrödongers doesn’t inspire fear, it inspires uncertainty. And until you prove you can string two good weeks together, you’re just a shiny mid-table ornament pretending to be a contender.

## 💀 Andrew “Cunha Get Me Points” Smith — 40 pts
Andrew, you’re the league’s eternal bridesmaid. Forty points and a solid W over Kyle puts you firmly in the top-3 scorers this week, but your aura screams “good, not great.” You’re the guy who brings the expensive wine to the party but still gets outshone by someone showing up with a six-pack.

To your credit, your squad looks sharp on paper. You’ve got balance, you’ve got depth, and this week you had enough punch to slap down Extended Foreplay without breaking a sweat. But here’s the problem: you’re still not feared. Nobody looks at your fixture and thinks, “damn, I’m in trouble.” They think, “this might be close, but I can take him.” You’re the league’s permanent almost-upset.

Still, this was one of your cleaner weeks. Forty points isn’t world-class, but it’s sturdy, consistent, and — dare I say — respectable. You’re building credibility brick by brick, but right now the house looks more like a nice shed.

## 💀 Zryan “FootAndBallFetish” Bhao — 38 pts
Zryan, congratulations: you’ve finally graduated from *league mattress* to *league futon*. Thirty-eight points and your first win of the season — against Noah, which is basically like dunking on a seven-year-old using a Fisher-Price hoop. Still, you broke the duck, so I’ll give you that.

But let’s not pretend this means you’re back. Your team is still a Frankenstein’s monster stitched together from bad decisions and wishful thinking. Most weeks you look like you drafted blindfolded while skimming Wikipedia. Beating Noah is less a statement of intent and more an accidental reminder that even broken slot machines pay out sometimes.

You’re 1–4, and this “historic” W will probably be your Super Bowl. Enjoy it. Frame it. Tattoo it across your chest. Because it might be the only thing keeping you warm when you’re back to being everyone else’s free points generator by GW6.

## 💀 Josiah “thenotsospecialone” Loh — 36 pts
Josiah, still undefeated at 5–0. On paper, that’s dominance. In reality? It’s the fantasy equivalent of surviving five car crashes in a row and calling yourself a Formula 1 driver. Thirty-six points got the job done against Ron, but it didn’t impress anyone.

Here’s the truth: you don’t *win* games, you *outlast* people. You’re the cockroach of this league — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow thriving in disaster. Everyone looks at your record and thinks, “wow, 5–0.” But everyone who actually watches knows it’s built on opponents tripping over shoelaces.

You’re not feared, Josiah. You’re tolerated. And the longer you sit at the top without actually blowing anyone out, the louder the whispers get: this guy’s a fraud waiting to be exposed. Undefeated for now, but all it’ll take is one decent manager actually showing up, and you’ll get flattened like a pancake at a steamroller convention.

## 💀 Kyle “Extended Foreplay” Herrera — 32 pts
Kyle, every week you prove your team name is perfect. Thirty-two points. Extended Foreplay. You tease, you linger, you build the anticipation… and then when it’s time to deliver, nothing. You left the league hanging again, and Andrew finished the job for you.

Your squad is as uninspiring as elevator music. Functional, but utterly joyless. No sparks, no drama, just enough competence to avoid being a complete embarrassment. You’re 3–2, but your wins are about as sexy as tax season. Nobody fears playing you; they just hope they don’t fall asleep doing it.

Extended Foreplay isn’t a brand anymore — it’s a public service announcement: “Warning: This team may result in boredom, frustration, or the sudden urge to check other fixtures.” Congratulations, Kyle. You’re not bad, but you’re aggressively forgettable.

## 💀 Ronangel “Atlético SeaSlug” Rojas — 29 pts
Ron, 29 points. Watching your team is like watching a snail in rush hour: slow, vulnerable, and guaranteed to get crushed by something bigger. You didn’t just lose to Josiah — you politely laid down in traffic and let him drive over you.

Your squad construction is tragic comedy. Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug, your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and your defense oscillates between “mildly competent” and “furniture.” The only thing consistent about Atlético SeaSlug is how predictably irrelevant it is.

The sad part? Your two wins this season are against the league’s human NPCs — Noah and Zryan. That’s not pedigree; that’s charity. You’re the kind of manager who flexes in the mirror after winning a thumb war against a toddler. The moment you face an opponent with actual pulse, you fold faster than a paper airplane in a thunderstorm.

Atlético SeaSlug isn’t a team — it’s a biology exhibit. Slimy, slow, and destined to get crushed under someone’s shoe. 🐌

## 💀 Noah “Trophies Matter FC” Wilson — 27 pts
Noah, every week your team comes out looking like a Craigslist free section — random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of disappointment. Twenty-seven points against Zryan, a guy who was literally 0–4 coming in, is humiliation on a level that deserves its own ESPN 30-for-30 documentary.

You’ve got one win this season, and it was in Week 1 against Kyle when he was still assembling Ikea furniture instead of a lineup. Since then? Freefall. Losing to Zryan is like losing a race to someone running backwards — humiliating, preventable, and deeply funny for everyone else.

“Trophies Matter FC”? Bro, the only trophy you’re competing for is “Most Forgettable Season.” If this league had relegation, you’d already be playing MLS Fantasy with suburban dads who draft goalkeepers first.

---

## 💀 Peter “Peattle Pounders” Henze — 27 pts
Peter, whatever miracle potion you drank in GW4 is clearly out of your system. You’re back to 27 points, back to losing, and back to being the league’s crash-test dummy. That 57-pointer last week? A fever dream. A one-night stand with competence. And like all one-night stands, it ghosted you the morning after.

Your team name should be “Peattle Pounded,” because every matchup ends with you on the receiving end. You’re 1–4, and the “1” already feels like it should have an asterisk. Every decision you make screams “desperation cosplay.” You’re not building a roster; you’re praying into the void and hoping the fantasy gods forget you exist.

At this point, your role in the league is clear: morale booster. Everyone circles you on the schedule, rubs their hands, and thanks the heavens they’ve got a free win incoming. You’re the participation ribbon personified.

---

## 💀 Sean “Gweepy” Dunn — 27 pts
Sean, 27 points and somehow you still scraped a win. That’s not a performance; that’s burglary. You walked out of GW5 like a raccoon who stumbled into a jewelry store, pawed at a couple shiny things, and sprinted off before anyone noticed.

Three wins on the season makes you look respectable, but peel back the numbers and it’s nothing but duct tape and dumb luck. You’re not climbing the table; you’re clinging to it like a cat dangling from a ceiling fan. Your team isn’t built, it’s improvised — a patchwork quilt of mediocrity that occasionally lights up when the dice roll your way.

You’re not feared. You’re not respected. You’re tolerated. And the moment your luck dips, you’ll be right back where you belong: comic relief. Until then, enjoy this fluke of survival.

## 💀 Harry “cunha believe it” Liu — 23 pts
Harry, this was not a gameweek. This was a public shaming. Twenty-three points — so bad even the spreadsheet sighed when it loaded your row. You didn’t lose to Chris, you got obliterated. If this were boxing, the ref would’ve stopped it in the first round.

Your season has become a highlight reel of self-inflicted wounds. One week you look dangerous, the next you’re handing out points like party favors. Your name is “cunha believe it,” but every week the rest of us keep answering: no, we really can’t.

This wasn’t just a bad week, Harry — this was the kind of score people remember. The kind they bring up months later when you’re trying to argue you’re actually decent. You’ve become the blooper tape of the league: hilarious to watch, painful to live through.

---

## ⚰️ Roy “This Year FC” Boateng — 14 pts
Roy. Fourteen. Four. Teen. This wasn’t a score, this was a **public execution**. Your undefeated run came to an end not with a bang, but with the sad whimper of a deflated balloon. One week ago, you were strutting around with a perfect record, chest out, chin high, whispering “this year might be mine.” This week? We’re burying those hopes six feet deep.

This wasn’t just a loss. This was a collapse so catastrophic it deserves its own funeral mass. The procession starts here: Josiah carrying the coffin, Don awkwardly playing the organ, Peter crying tears of recognition because he’s been here all season. Your team didn’t show up. They didn’t even get on the bus. They sat at home, curled under a blanket, sipping chamomile tea and apologizing for existing.

We are gathered here today to mourn the short, fraudulent life of Roy’s credibility. Born Week 1, died Week 5, cause of death: exposure. He leaves behind a hollow 4–1 record, a team allergic to points, and a reputation in ruins. May he rest in peace, because his season sure won’t.

Amen. ⚰️🪦

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW5
GW5 was a carnival of incompetence. Don got to cosplay as a king, Chris remembered what points look like, and Andrew flirted with relevance. Zryan celebrated beating Noah like it was a Champions League final, Josiah stayed unbeaten but still looks like a con artist with good lighting, and Kyle delivered the kind of foreplay nobody asked for. Meanwhile, Ron slimed his way to irrelevance, Noah and Peter cemented themselves as league NPCs, Sean lucked into survival, Harry posted a score that belongs in a blooper reel, and Roy’s season was lowered into the ground while the rest of us danced on the grave.
