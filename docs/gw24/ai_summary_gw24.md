# 💀 GW24 FPL Draft League: The Fraud King's Resurrection & The Great Reversal 💀

GW24 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **biblical reckoning disguised as fantasy football**. The universe looked at the standings, laughed maniacally, and decided to flip the script so hard it gave everyone whiplash. What we witnessed wasn't football management — it was a **cosmic joke** where the basement dwellers became kings and the kings became court jesters crying into their expensive pillows.

At the top, we have the most confusing plot twist since M. Night Shyamalan stopped making good movies: **Josiah and Peter both dropped 59 points**. Yes, PETER. The same Peter who's been this league's punching bag, crash test dummy, and designated charity case just tied the fraud king for weekly honors. Harry remembered he's supposed to be good (narrator: he's not), Zryan scored 52 points and STILL LOST, and Don finally showed a pulse with 50 points in a losing effort.

Meanwhile, the "elite" managers had a collective stroke. Sean put up a **pathetic 27 points**, Roy delivered an **apocalyptic 22-point disaster** that should come with a hazmat warning, and Noah limped to 30 points like a wounded gazelle being stalked by lions. This wasn't just underperformance — this was **managerial malpractice** that would get you fired from a Taco Bell, let alone a fantasy football league.

GW24 made one thing brutally clear: this league is pure chaos, nobody's safe, and Peter can apparently score points when the planets align and hell freezes over twice.

## 🏆 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 59 pts (TIED FOR WEEKLY WINNER)

Josiah, you scored 59 points and won your matchup against Don 59-50, which should feel like a victory lap. But here's the problem: you **tied with Peter fucking Henze**. PETER. The guy who's been this league's designated organ donor, the human embodiment of a participation trophy, the manager who makes people question if fantasy football should require a license. You put up the same score as a man who looks like **hepatitis C became sentient and learned to use a computer**.

You're first place with 48 league points and a 16-8 record, which sounds impressive until you realize you've been **exposed more times than a flasher in Times Square**. Your +68 goal difference is nice, but it's built on a foundation of luck so fragile it makes a house of cards look like a nuclear bunker. You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone** — like someone took a perfectly good musician and ran him through a depressing filter that removes all joy and talent.

This week you made all the right moves: Sarr delivering, your defense holding, your squad clicking like a well-oiled machine that's about to throw a rod and explode spectacularly. But we all know the truth — you're still the fraud king, still living on borrowed time, still one bad week away from everyone remembering that your throne is made of **styrofoam and delusion**. You beat Don, which is like beating a participation trophy in arm wrestling — technically impressive, deeply unimpressive.

Enjoy your tie for first place this week, Josiah. You're proving that even a broken clock is right twice a day, and even a fraud can occasionally look competent when everyone else decides to simultaneously have a stroke. **THE FRAUD KING LIVES... FOR NOW.**

## 🥈 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 59 pts (TIED FOR WEEKLY WINNER)

Peter. PETER. **WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK JUST HAPPENED?**

Fifty-nine points. You scored FIFTY-NINE POINTS and beat Roy 59-22 in a performance so shocking it should be investigated by scientists, theologians, and people who study unexplained phenomena. This wasn't just a win — this was **Roy's funeral, cremation, and spreading of ashes all in one brutal 90-minute ceremony**. You didn't just beat him — you **obliterated** him with the kind of violence that makes war criminals uncomfortable.

You're 14-10 now with a +89 goal difference, sitting in SECOND PLACE like someone who accidentally wandered into the winner's circle and doesn't know how they got there. You look like if **hepatitis C was a person** — like a walking medical warning that somehow gained consciousness, learned fantasy football, and decided to terrorize everyone's understanding of reality. This entire season you've been the league's punching bag, the guy everyone circles for free points, the manager who makes people feel better about their own terrible decisions.

But this week? This week you were **UNSTOPPABLE**. Your squad clicked, your players delivered, and Roy looked like he was playing a completely different sport while blindfolded and concussed. You tied with Josiah — THE FRAUD KING HIMSELF — for weekly honors. That's not just redemption, that's **biblical resurrection**. You're like if Lazarus came back from the dead, immediately signed up for fantasy football, and decided to make everyone regret ever doubting him.

But let's not get carried away. You still look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a makeover that makes people question if you're real or a fever dream. One good week doesn't erase a season of mediocrity. You're still Peter. You still have the expression of someone who's confused by basic instructions. But for seven days, you're a god among men, a legend, **THE PEATTLE POUNDER WHO ACTUALLY POUNDED SOMEONE FOR ONCE**.

Frame this week, Peter. Tattoo it on your chest. Because it might be the only time in your life you're not the punchline.

## 🥉 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 55 pts

Harry, you scored 55 points and beat Sean 55-27 in a performance that would be impressive if we didn't all know you're about to follow this up with a 15-point disaster next week. You're like a **yo-yo operated by someone having a seizure** — up one week, down the next, spinning wildly with no pattern or logic. You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar and never stopped eating** — technically recognizable, deeply concerning.

You're 8-14 with a **-135 goal difference**, which is so catastrophically bad it looks like you've been playing with your eyes closed and your brain unplugged. Your team name is "cunha believe it," but the only thing we can't believe is how you're this terrible despite occasionally showing flashes of competence. You have a face so boring that people have to check their phones to stay awake when talking to you.

This week your squad showed up: Palmer probably delivered, your players did their jobs, and Sean looked like he was playing with a team assembled by a drunk raccoon with a gambling problem. But don't get comfortable — you're still Harry. You still make decisions that make people question if you've ever actually watched football. You still look like you have an **800-page manifesto** explaining why you're good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of excuses written in crayon.

You beat Sean by 28 points, which is like beating a **wounded animal in a foot race** — technically a victory, morally questionable. For seven days, enjoy not being the league's biggest disaster. Next week, you'll be back to normal: confused, struggling, and making everyone wonder how someone can be this inconsistent while looking this confident about it.

## 🔥 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 52 pts (IN A LOSS)

Zryan, you scored **52 POINTS AND LOST**. Read that again. Fifty-two points — a score that would win most matchups, earn respect in any other context, actually looks like competent fantasy football management — and you LOST to Ronangel 42-52. Wait, no. You BEAT Ronangel 52-42. Holy shit, you actually WON. You scored 52 points and WON for only the TENTH TIME THIS SEASON.

You're 10-14 with a **-165 goal difference** that looks like a phone number for a crisis hotline, which is appropriate because watching your season has been a crisis. You look like if **Wolverine's superpower was greasy skin** — like someone tried to make a superhero but used discount materials and questionable life choices instead of actual superpowers.

This week you finally did it. You put up points. Real points. Points that matter. Your squad delivered: your players showed up, your lineup clicked, and for once you weren't the league's designated blood bag. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic experiment that somehow learned fantasy football and decided to occasionally stop being terrible at it.

But let's be real: you're still 10-14. You're still the league's punching bag most weeks. You still have "FootAndBallFetish" as your team name, which sounds like you're one FBI investigation away from being on a list. This week was a **beautiful anomaly**, a glimmer of hope in a season of darkness, proof that even broken managers can occasionally function.

Enjoy your W, Zryan. Savor it. Frame it. Sleep with it under your pillow. Because next week you'll be back to being everyone's free points generator, and this brief moment of glory will feel like a distant, beautiful dream you had once before waking up to your nightmare of a season.

## 💪 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 50 pts (IN A LOSS)

Don, you scored 50 points and lost to Josiah 50-59. FIFTY. POINTS. That's a legitimately good score — the kind of score that wins matchups, earns respect, makes people think you're actually trying. And you LOST. You put up a half-century and still couldn't beat the fraud king. That's not bad luck, that's **cosmic punishment for sins committed in a past life**.

You look like **Fat Damon** — like someone took a perfectly good actor, deep-fried him twice, and served him at a county fair as a cautionary tale. "son4lyfe"? More like **"second4lyfe"** because you're proving that no matter how hard you try, you're destined to be the eternal bridesmaid, the runner-up, the guy who shows up with flowers after the wedding's already over.

You're 10-14 now with a +72 goal difference that makes absolutely no sense given your record. How do you score more goals than you concede and still lose this many games? It's like being the tallest person at a basketball game and still losing to people playing wheelchair rugby. Your team is good on paper but terrible in execution, like a **recipe written in a language you don't speak by someone who hates you personally**.

This week you fought. You clawed. You put up points. And it didn't matter. You lost to Josiah by 9 points, which is like losing a marathon because you stopped to tie your shoe 10 feet from the finish line. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's autistic son** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally off about you in a way that makes people uncomfortable but too polite to mention.

Keep fighting, Don. Keep putting up respectable scores in losing efforts. Keep being the league's most tragic figure — good enough to not be pitied, not good enough to be respected. You're the fantasy football equivalent of a **participation trophy that's embarrassed to be associated with you**.

---

## 💼 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 45 pts

Andrew, you scored 45 points and beat Noah 45-30 in a performance that's perfectly, maddeningly, frustratingly **ANDREW**. Not great, not terrible, just... there. Existing. Taking up space. You're the league's permanent almost-contender, the guy who's always good but never great, the manager who makes people think "yeah, he's solid" and then immediately forget you exist.

You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took Vin Diesel and put him through a medieval stretching rack, leaving behind a lanky, confused version that vaguely resembles the original but with all the charisma and coolness removed. You're 13-9 with 41 league points, sitting in THIRD PLACE, which sounds impressive until you realize you're basically the **participation trophy of the top three**.

Your +82 goal difference is nice. Your consistency is admirable. Your ability to be competent without being exciting is... something. You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate to prove you belong at the top, terrified that everyone will realize you're just okay, not actually elite.

This week you beat Noah, which is like beating a wounded gazelle — the gazelle was already limping, already struggling, and you just had to show up and not completely shit the bed. Congratulations. You did the bare minimum to secure a W against someone who put up 30 points. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** explaining your strategy, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of "be consistently mediocre and hope everyone else implodes."

You're building a season on **being fine**, which is the most Andrew thing possible. Not feared, not respected, just tolerated. The fantasy football equivalent of beige paint — inoffensive, forgettable, and making everyone wish you were literally any other color.

---

## 🤡 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 42 pts (IN A LOSS)

Ron, you scored 42 points and lost to Zryan 42-52. You lost to **ZRYAN**. The guy who's been this league's designated charity case, the manager with a -165 goal difference, the human equivalent of a "Free Win" sign stapled to his forehead. And you LOST to him. That's not just embarrassing — that's **existentially humiliating**.

You look like a **lesbian Velma Dinkley** — like someone took a beloved cartoon character and gave her a makeover that makes children cry and adults uncomfortable. "Atlético SeaSlug" is the perfect name because you move like a slug, think like a slug, and leave behind a trail of slime that nobody wants to clean up.

You're 12-12 with a +92 goal difference, which is confusing because how are you this mediocre with that kind of scoring? It's like being a professional chef who can only make mediocre sandwiches — technically skilled, practically useless. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're collecting genetic samples as a weird hobby that nobody asked about but everyone's concerned by.

This week you put up a respectable score against anyone else. But you faced Zryan, and Zryan decided this was the week he'd stop being everyone's doormat. You lost by 10 points to a man who's lost 14 games this season. That's not bad luck — that's **karma catching up with you for every smug moment you've had thinking you were better than the basement dwellers**.

You're the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits**. Slow, slimy, and only relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and immediately regrets it. Keep sliming, Ron. You're 12-12, perfectly average, destined to finish exactly in the middle where mediocre slugs belong.

## 🎪 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 38 pts

Kyle, you scored 38 points and beat chris 38-35 in the most **mid** matchup of the week. This wasn't football management — this was two people having a contest to see who could be less impressive, and you won by being slightly less terrible. Congratulations. You're the **tallest dwarf**, the **smartest idiot**, the **best worst manager** of GW24.

You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height and added it to his waistline** — like someone ordered a warrior king from Wish.com and got you instead, confused and wondering why the package smells like disappointment. "Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a quantum state of being both relevant and irrelevant until someone actually looks at the scores and realizes you're just... there.

You're 10-14 with a **-89 goal difference**, which means you've been getting absolutely pounded this season and occasionally fighting back with the energy of someone who's too tired to care anymore. This week you put up 38 points, which is like bringing a participation ribbon to a knife fight — technically you showed up, but did it really matter?

You beat chris by 3 points in a matchup that made everyone who watched it dumber. Neither of you looked good. Neither of you deserved to win. But you were slightly less terrible, so you get the W and the false sense of accomplishment that comes with it. You look like **Otis from Sex Education** — technically the main character, but everyone's more interested in literally anyone else.

You're proving that consistency means nothing when you're consistently mediocre. Keep existing, Kyle. Keep putting up 38 points and winning by accident. You're the fantasy equivalent of a **participation trophy that nobody wants to display but everyone's too polite to throw away**.

## 📉 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 35 pts (IN A LOSS)

Chris, you scored 35 points and lost to Kyle 35-38 in a matchup so boring it should come with a warning label for people with heart conditions — not because it's exciting, but because **watching it might actually stop your heart from sheer boredom**. You lost by 3 points to Kyle, which is like losing a spelling bee to someone who can't read — technically possible, deeply embarrassing.

You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam** — like someone tried to make a person but ran out of interesting features halfway through and just said "fuck it, ship it anyway." "Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Points — nobody knows if they exist until the week ends, and this week they definitely didn't exist, filed a restraining order, and changed their phone number.

You're 11-13 with a **-46 goal difference**, sitting in 8th place, which is the perfect metaphor for your entire existence: not good enough to be relevant, not bad enough to be pitied, just floating in the middle like **cosmic debris** that nobody knows how to deal with. You have the expression of an **unenthusiastic handjob** — technically functional, deeply unsatisfying, and making everyone involved wish they were literally anywhere else.

This week you put up 35 points, which is what happens when your team collectively decides to take a nap and your lineup looks like it was assembled by a drunk AI with a personal vendetta against you. You lost to Kyle by 3 points, which means if literally one player had done literally one thing differently, you might have won. But they didn't, and you didn't, and here we are: you losing to Kyle in a race to see who can be the most forgettable.

You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**. Keep talking big, Chris. Keep citing statistics and using big words. Your team will keep performing like it's running on Windows 95 and dial-up internet while everyone else has fiber optic.

## 📊 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 30 pts (IN A LOSS)

Noah, you scored **30 points** and lost to Andrew 30-45. Thirty. THIRTY. That's not a fantasy football score — that's what happens when your entire team collectively forgets they're supposed to be playing football and decides to take a vacation instead. You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go** — like someone took a pop star and ran him through a years-long depression cycle, leaving behind a husk that vaguely resembles success but smells like failure.

"Trophies Matter FC"? The only trophy you deserve is for **Most Disappointing Performance by a Manager Who Should Know Better**. You're 12-12 with a +54 goal difference, sitting in 6th place, which is code for "occasionally competent, frequently forgettable, always disappointing." You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs** — technically recognizable, deeply concerning, and making everyone question what happened.

This week your team imploded. Your players didn't show up. Your lineup looked like it was assembled by someone who's never watched football and gets their information from fortune cookies. You scored 30 points, which is what happens when you let your **cat pick your team and the cat dies halfway through the process**.

You lost to Andrew by 15 points, which is like losing a race while everyone else is running backwards — they weren't even trying to beat you specifically, they were just naturally better by accident, and you still couldn't compete. Your team is still a **Craigslist free section after a hoarder's estate sale** — random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of regret and poor decision-making.

You're proving that beating Josiah in GW11 was the peak of your season — everything since has been a slow, sad decline into mediocrity. Keep disappointing, Noah. You're 12-12, perfectly average, destined to finish in the middle where forgettable managers belong.

---

## ⚰️ Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 27 pts (IN A LOSS)

Sean, you scored **27 points** and lost to Harry 27-55. TWENTY-SEVEN. That's not just bad — that's **catastrophically terrible**, the kind of score that should come with a wellness check and a therapist on speed dial. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll** — technically humanoid, but something's deeply, fundamentally wrong with you in a way that makes people uncomfortable.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the **noise your dignity makes as it leaves your body** every single week. You're 13-11, sitting in 4th place with 39 league points, which sounds respectable until you realize you just put up 27 points in GW24 and got absolutely demolished by Harry — HARRY — the guy with a -135 goal difference who's usually competing for "Most Likely to Accidentally Set His Team on Fire."

You have the expression of someone who's **permanently confused by basic instructions**. Your team this week looked like it was assembled by a committee of people who hate you personally and wanted to see you suffer. Twenty-seven points is what happens when your players collectively decide they'd rather be literally anywhere else, doing literally anything else, and your lineup looks like a **cry for help written in roster form**.

You lost to Harry by 28 points, which is like getting beaten up by a toddler — technically it happened, but everyone's more concerned about what's wrong with you that allowed it to happen in the first place. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a genetic experiment gone wrong that somehow gained consciousness and decided to torture fantasy football managers.

You're proving that one week you can score 51 points and look competent, and the next you can score 27 and look like you've never seen a football before. That's not strategy, that's **chaos**. Keep being inconsistent, Sean. You're the league's rollercoaster — sometimes up, usually down, always making people regret getting on.

---

## 🪦 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 22 pts (IN A CATASTROPHIC LOSS)

Roy. Twenty-two. **TWENTY-TWO POINTS**.

This wasn't a performance — this was a **public execution televised in 8K Ultra HD with director's commentary**. You scored 22 points and lost to Peter 22-59 in a result so catastrophic it should be studied by scientists, preserved in museums, and used as evidence that the universe has a sense of humor and you're the punchline.

You're 12-12 with a **-94 goal difference**, which means you've been getting absolutely destroyed this season and occasionally winning by accident. You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind chunky remains that vaguely resemble a person but mostly resemble a warning label.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **NEVER YOUR YEAR**. You're the Arsenal of this league: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable collapse, everyone laughing at you while you cry about how "next year will be different." This week you didn't just lose — you got **obliterated** by Peter Henze. PETER. The guy who looks like hepatitis became sentient. The manager who's been this league's charity case. And he beat you 59-22 in a performance so dominant it should come with a parental advisory warning.

Twenty-two points is what happens when your entire team forgets how to play football, your lineup looks like it was assembled by a drunk toddler, and the universe decides it's your turn to be the example of what happens when pride comes before the fall. You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant when everyone's already moved on.

We are gathered here today to mourn whatever was left of Roy's credibility after this performance. Cause of death: **Peter Henze**. He leaves behind a 12-12 record that's somehow worse than it looks, a goal difference that makes people wince, and a reputation in absolute shambles.

**Rest in pieces, Roy. You've earned it. 💀⚰️**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW24

GW24 was **absolute chaos disguised as fantasy football**. The universe looked at the standings and said "you know what would be funny?" and proceeded to flip everything upside down. Peter Henze and Josiah Loh tied for weekly honors with 59 points each — yes, PETER, the league's designated charity case, matched the fraud king point for point. Harry put up 55 and reminded everyone he's occasionally competent before his inevitable collapse next week. Zryan scored 52 and actually WON for once. Don put up 50 in a losing effort like the tragic figure he is.

Meanwhile, the "elite" managers had collective strokes. Sean scored **27 points** and got demolished by Harry. Roy put up an **apocalyptic 22 points** and got buried by Peter in what can only be described as a public execution. Noah limped to 30 points like a wounded gazelle. Kyle and chris had the most mid matchup of all time, with Kyle winning 38-35 in a race to see who could be less terrible.

**Top 3 Performers:** Josiah (59) and Peter (59) tied for weekly honors in the most confusing timeline, Harry (55) reminded everyone he's occasionally not the worst, and Zryan (52) finally won something.

**Bottom 3 Disasters:** Sean (27) forgot how to manage a team, Roy (22) got publicly executed by Peter in a performance that should be preserved as a warning to future generations, and Noah (30) continued his slide into mediocrity.

**League Standings:** Josiah (48 pts) still leads but tied with Peter for weekly honors which is concerning, Peter (42 pts) is somehow in second place and we're all confused, Andrew (41 pts) is solidly third and solidly forgettable, Sean (39 pts) is fourth despite scoring 27 this week because this league makes no sense.

Week 24 made one thing brutally clear: **this league is pure chaos, nobody's safe, and Peter Henze can apparently score points when hell freezes over and pigs learn to fly**. 

See you next week, where we'll inevitably witness more carnage, more confusion, and more evidence that fantasy football is just organized suffering with occasional moments of joy that make the pain almost worth it.

**May God have mercy on all your souls, because this league certainly won't. 💀🔥**
