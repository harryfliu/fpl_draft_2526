# 💀 GW11 FPL Draft League: The Great Reckoning & The Fraud King's Second Funeral 💀

GW11 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **massacre disguised as fantasy football**. The universe finally decided to balance the scales, and the result was a bloodbath so spectacular it should be preserved in the Louvre under the title *Portrait of Justice Served Cold*.

At the top, Harry — yes, **Harry** — finally remembered he's supposed to be playing football and delivered a performance so dominant it made Roy look like a toddler trying to eat the dice. Noah pulled off the upset of the century, Sean remembered what competence looks like, and Kyle decided to show up for once. These four didn't just win — they **obliterated** their opponents with the kind of violence that would make a war criminal blush.

The mid-table is a graveyard of broken dreams. Andrew continues to be the league's permanent almost-contender, Chris remembered he's supposed to be mid, and Peter somehow beat Ron in a battle of who's less terrible. But the real story? **Josiah lost again**. The fraud king's second funeral is here, and this time Noah is the one dancing on the grave.

At the bottom, Roy got **publicly executed** by Harry, Ron slimed his way to another L, Don continued his eternal bridesmaid tour, and Zryan is still the league's designated punching bag. But none of that matters because **JOSIAH FINALLY LOST AGAIN**.

Week 11 made one thing clear: nobody is safe. Not even the fraud king.

## 🏆 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 54 pts

Harry, for once you're not the punchline — you're the **executioner**. Fifty-four points, weekly winner, $11 richer. You didn't just beat Roy — you **obliterated** him 54-29 in a performance so dominant it should come with a parental advisory warning. This wasn't some "oops I lucked into a result" score — this was **controlled chaos**, the kind of lineup that makes the rest of us question if hell just froze over twice.

But don't get too comfortable, because let's be clear: this is still Harry we're talking about. You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your season has been a highlight reel of self-inflicted wounds, catastrophic decisions, and moments that make people question if you've ever actually watched football before. You're 5-6 with a goal difference of -82, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*.

You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement. Your team name is "cunha believe it," but every week the rest of us keep answering: no, we really can't. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe.

Still, respect where it's due: you were the only one this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test. For seven days, you're king of the clowns. Enjoy the throne, because next week the circus is back on tour and you're usually the guy juggling fire while setting himself on fire.

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 53 pts

Noah, you didn't just win — you **slayed the fraud king**. Fifty-three points and you beat Josiah 53-52 in a result so shocking it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers in crisis. This wasn't just a win — this was **regicide**. You didn't just beat Josiah — you **exposed** him as the fraud we all knew he was.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, you just beat the **fraud king** by one point. That's not a trophy — that's a **monument to justice**. You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go** — like someone took a perfectly good pop star and ran him through a discount blender set to "questionable life choices." You're 5-6 now, but this win will be remembered long after Josiah's fraudulent empire crumbles. This is the kind of victory that gets whispered about in therapy sessions — the kind that makes people question everything they thought they knew about fantasy football.

But let's not pretend this means you're back. Your team is still a Craigslist free section after a hoarder's estate sale — random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of disappointment. You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Beating Josiah is less a statement of intent and more an accidental reminder that even broken slot machines pay out sometimes. Still, you did it. You beat the fraud king. Frame it. Tattoo it across your chest. Because it might be the only thing keeping you warm when you're back to being everyone else's free points generator by GW12.

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 52 pts

Josiah, you lost. **Again**. Fifty-two points and you lost to Noah 52-53 in a result so embarrassing it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers in crisis. This wasn't just a loss — this was **the second funeral of the fraud king**. Your undefeated aura is gone, your fraudulent empire is crumbling, and Noah is dancing on your grave.

You're 9-2 now, which is still good on paper, but everyone knows you're an empty husk floating on luck's tide like driftwood nobody wants to pick up. You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. You don't *win* games, you *outlast* people like a cockroach outlasts a nuclear apocalypse — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow thriving in disaster while everyone wishes you'd just disappear already.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people cross the street when they see you coming, like you're a walking biohazard warning. But here's the truth: you're not feared, Josiah. You're tolerated like a bad smell in an elevator that everyone's too polite to mention. And now everyone knows you're the fraud we always said you were, the emperor with no clothes, the wizard behind the curtain, the participation trophy king whose reign of terror has ended in the most embarrassing way possible. **THE FRAUD KING HAS BEEN EXPOSED AGAIN, AND IT FEELS SO GOOD.**

---

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 51 pts

Sean, you finally remembered what competence looks like. Fifty-one points and you beat Don 51-34 in a performance so clean it made the rest of us question if you've been replaced by an AI that's been programmed to win. This wasn't some "oops I lucked into a result" score — this was **actual football management**, the kind of lineup that makes people respect you, even if they don't want to admit it.

But don't get too comfortable, because let's be clear: this is still Sean we're talking about. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your season has been a rollercoaster of inconsistency — one week you're a football god with 63 points, the next you're a football mortal with 27 points. You're 6-5 now, which puts you in a position of cosmic confusion in the league. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** (GW8: 63 pts, GW11: 51 pts) and **INCREDIBLY BAD** (GW10: 27 pts) in the span of three weeks, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the noise a **cartoon pigeon makes when it flies into a window**. And that's you — every single week. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic crime scene that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment files for divorce and gets custody of the worst parts. Still, respect where it's due: you were one of the few this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test. For seven days, you're not the punchline. Enjoy it while it lasts.

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 49 pts

Kyle, you finally decided to show up. Forty-nine points and you beat Zryan 49-37 in a performance so clean it made the rest of us question if you've been replaced by an AI that's been programmed to win. This wasn't some "oops I lucked into a result" score — this was **actual football management**, the kind of lineup that makes people respect you, even if they don't want to admit it.

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a quantum state where it's simultaneously good and bad, exciting and boring, relevant and irrelevant, all at the same time until someone actually looks at it and the wave function collapses into whatever reality is most convenient for the narrative. You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height and added it to his waistline** — like someone tried to make a warrior but accidentally ordered the "dad bod" version from Wish.com. Last week you were a football god who won GW9. This week you're Schrödinger's Manager — both competent and terrible until the gameweek ends, and then you're just... there.

You're 6-5 now, which puts you in a position of cosmic confusion in the league. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** (GW9: winner, GW11: 49 pts) and **INCREDIBLY BAD** (GW6: 17 pts) in the span of five weeks, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them. You look like **Otis from sex education** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you.

Still, respect where it's due: you were one of the few this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test. For seven days, you're not the punchline. Enjoy it while it lasts.

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 48 pts

Andrew, you're the league's eternal bridesmaid. Forty-eight points and a solid W over Chris puts you firmly in the top-6 scorers this week, but your aura screams "good, not great." You're the guy who brings the expensive wine to the party but still gets outshone by someone showing up with a six-pack. You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star and put him through a dehydrator, leaving behind a husk that vaguely resembles what used to be cool.

To your credit, your squad looks sharp on paper. You've got balance, you've got depth, and this week you had enough punch to slap down Schrödongers without breaking a sweat. But here's the problem: you're still not feared. Nobody looks at your fixture and thinks, "damn, I'm in trouble." They think, "this might be close, but I can take him." You're the league's permanent almost-contender. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe for not being great.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. Still, this was one of your cleaner weeks. Forty-eight points isn't world-class, but it's sturdy, consistent, and — dare I say — respectable. You're 8-3 now, which puts you in second place, but you're building credibility brick by brick, and right now the house looks more like a nice shed than a mansion.

---

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 39 pts

Peter, 39 points and you beat Ron 39-30. That's like beating a slug in a race — technically true, deeply unimpressive. You're 3-8 now, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*. You look like if **hepatitis C was a person** — like a walking medical warning label that makes people instinctively back away, wondering if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a disease gets bored and decides to try fantasy football.

"Peattle Pounders"? You're not a Pounder. You're a **Peashooter firing blanks at a brick wall**. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into Oblivion," because every matchup ends with you on the receiving end, curled up in the fetal position, questioning every life choice that led you to this moment. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people hold their breath when you walk by, like you're a walking biohazard that escaped from a food court dumpster.

You beat Ron by 9 points, which is like watching a **SLOTH WIN A RACE** against a **TURTLE** who's also running backwards. It's technically impressive, but also deeply confusing because neither of you should be winning anything, yet here you are, winning things, and we're all just trying to process what that means for the universe. You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a questionable makeover that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a mascot gets fired and tries to reinvent itself.

Enjoy your W over Ron, Peter. You're proving that being terrible isn't just your superpower — it's your entire identity, your legacy, and the only thing people will remember about you long after you've quit the league in shame.

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 37 pts

Zryan, 37 points and you lost to Kyle 37-49. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K** for maximum humiliation. You're 1-10 now, which means you've been everyone's free points generator for so long you should start charging rent, except nobody would pay because even your losses are worthless. You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used cooking oil instead of adamantium, leaving you with a sheen that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment goes to therapy and gets worse.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation, degradation, and being the league's designated punching bag**. Every week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine, your dignity, and whatever's left of your self-respect. Thirty-seven points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock, let my cat pick my team, and the cat dies halfway through the process**. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets drunk and makes terrible life choices.

You lost to Kyle by 12 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also playing a different sport, who's also not trying, and who's also Kyle. Your 1-10 record is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you're still here, still trying, still losing, but with a kind of determination that's almost admirable if it weren't so tragic.

You're not a manager, you're a **community service project for managers who need to feel better about themselves**. Everyone circles you on the schedule, rubs their hands, and thanks the heavens they've got a free win incoming. You're the fantasy equivalent of a bye week, except bye weeks are actually useful.

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 34 pts

Don, 34 points and you lost to Sean 34-51. That's not a loss, that's a **tragedy in three acts**: hope, disappointment, and everyone laughing at you while you cry into your pillow at night. You look like **Fat Damon** — like someone took a perfectly good actor and put him through a deep fryer, leaving behind a puffy, greasy version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own celebrity.

"son4lyfe"? Bro, Son would probably file a **restraining order** if he knew you existed. You're more like **second4lyfe**, destined to always be the runner-up, the also-ran, the guy who peaked in the second round and never saw glory again. You lost to Sean by 17 points — congrats, you **DUNKED ON A SIX-FOOT RIM** while wearing platform shoes and still managed to look uncoordinated doing it. You look like you have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement.

You're 4-7 now, which is the perfect metaphor for your life: not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... there, floating in the middle of the league like a **cosmic anomaly** that nobody knows how to deal with. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's autistic son** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you.

Enjoy your loss to Sean, Don. You're proving that even broken clocks are right twice a day, but you're also proving that even when you're right, you're still wrong, and that's the most Don thing about you.

---

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 32 pts

Chris, 32 points and you lost to Andrew 32-48. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K** for maximum humiliation. You're 6-5 now, which is so mediocre it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*. You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you.

"Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over — and this week, they didn't exist, they never existed, and they're filing a restraining order against you for claiming they're associated with you. You're not quantum, bro. You're just **both mid and overhyped at the same time**, existing in a superposition of mediocrity and delusion. You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient, leaving you with an expression that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gives up halfway through.

You lost to Andrew by 16 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also playing a different sport, who's also not trying, and who's also Andrew. Your 6-5 record is like having a **credit score that's actually a negative number**, which shouldn't be possible but you've somehow achieved it through sheer determination to be terrible while looking competent on paper.

You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**. You speak in theories, cite statistics, use big words, but your team performs like it's running PowerPoint slides from 2003 instead of plays. Every L you get feels like a **statistical hiccup in the matrix**, except the matrix is tired of your excuses and has filed a complaint. You look like you must have been an **auctioneer in your past life and so you've spent this lifetime repenting for it** — like someone who talks too fast and makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment tries to become a motivational speaker and fails spectacularly.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 30 pts

Ron, 30 points and you lost to Peter 30-39. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K** for maximum humiliation. You're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits**. A slug with a jersey, except the slug is more productive and has better decision-making skills. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you.

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison. Every time you manage to scrape 30 points, the entire league side-eyes the calendar like, "Who got cursed this week?" and then realizes it's just Ron being Ron, which is somehow worse than a curse. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets confused and starts collecting DNA samples in its mouth.

You lost to Peter by 9 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also terrible, who's also not trying, and who's also Peter. Your 5-6 record is so mediocre it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you're still here, still trying, still losing, but with a kind of determination that's almost admirable if it weren't so tragic.

Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug at a retirement home. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you. Your defense oscillates between "mildly competent" and "furniture from IKEA that nobody knows how to assemble." Watching your team is like watching a snail in rush hour: slow, vulnerable, guaranteed to get crushed by something bigger, and leaving a disgusting trail that nobody wants to clean up.

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 5-6, still irrelevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. 🐌**

---

## ⚰️ Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 29 pts

Roy. Twenty-nine. This wasn't a score, this was a **public execution**. You lost to Harry 29-54 in a performance so catastrophic it should be preserved in the Louvre under the title *Portrait of a Fraud Exposed*. One week ago, you were strutting around with an 8-2 record, chest out, chin high, whispering "this year might be mine." This week? We're burying those hopes six feet deep.

This wasn't just a loss. This was a collapse so catastrophic it deserves its own funeral mass. The procession starts here: Harry carrying the coffin, Noah awkwardly playing the organ, Peter crying tears of recognition because he's been here all season. Your team didn't show up. They didn't even get on the bus. They sat at home, curled under a blanket, sipping chamomile tea and apologizing for existing. You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind a chunky, questionable version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own Frank Sinatra and fails catastrophically.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke coming soon. You're 8-3 and somehow people are still calling you a fraud, which should tell you everything you need to know about your "dominance." You lost to Harry by 25 points — that's not a loss, that's **Harry filming a live-action snuff film with you as the star, director, producer, and only audience member stupid enough to buy a ticket**. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. We are gathered here today to mourn the short, fraudulent life of Roy's credibility. Born Week 1, died Week 11, cause of death: exposure. He leaves behind a hollow 8-3 record, a team allergic to points, and a reputation in ruins. May he rest in peace, because his season sure won't.

**Amen. ⚰️🪦**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW11

GW11 was a **massacre disguised as fantasy football**. Harry finally remembered he's supposed to be playing football and delivered a performance so dominant it made Roy look like a toddler trying to eat the dice. Noah pulled off the upset of the century by beating Josiah, Sean remembered what competence looks like, and Kyle decided to show up for once. Meanwhile, Andrew continued to be the league's permanent almost-contender, Chris remembered he's supposed to be mid, and Peter somehow beat Ron in a battle of who's less terrible.

But the real story? **Josiah lost again**. The fraud king's second funeral is here, and this time Noah is the one dancing on the grave. Roy got publicly executed by Harry, Ron slimed his way to another L, Don continued his eternal bridesmaid tour, and Zryan is still the league's designated punching bag.

**Top 3:** Harry (54) finally remembered he's supposed to be good, Noah (53) slayed the fraud king by one point, and Josiah (52) got exposed for the second time in three weeks — the fraud king's empire is crumbling faster than a house of cards in a hurricane.

Week 11 made one thing clear: nobody is safe. Not even the fraud king.
