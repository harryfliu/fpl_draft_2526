# 💀 GW18 FPL Draft League: The Fraud King's Empire Crumbles While Noah Ascends to Godhood 💀

GW18 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **public execution disguised as fantasy football**. The universe finally decided to stop playing games and delivered justice so cold it should be served with a side of frostbite warnings. This wasn't football, this was **karma collecting debts with compound interest**.

At the top, Noah and Peter both dropped 52-point nuclear bombs on their opponents, but Noah's was special — he **obliterated Harry 52-20** in a performance so dominant it should come with a viewer discretion warning. Ron somehow remembered he's supposed to be competent and delivered 46 points, Sean continued his December dominance tour, and Josiah? **JOSIAH LOST TO PETER**. The fraud king's empire isn't just crumbling — it's being demolished brick by brick while we all watch and laugh.

The mid-table is a morgue of broken dreams and shattered egos. Andrew scraped together 33 points to beat Roy, Chris managed 29 points which is somehow both terrible and enough to win, and Roy continued his free fall from grace with 27 points. But the real story? **JOSIAH LOST AGAIN**. This is becoming a weekly funeral service.

At the bottom, Don got **publicly humiliated** by Chris, Zryan took another beating from Sean, Harry got **murdered on live television** by Noah, and Kyle... Kyle managed 16 points. SIXTEEN. That's not a score, that's a cry for help. But none of that matters because **THE FRAUD KING LOST TO PETER HENZE**.

Week 18 made one thing crystal clear: Josiah's reign of terror is over, and we're all here to dance on the grave.

## 🏆 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 52 pts

Noah, you didn't just win — you **committed a war crime**. Fifty-two points and you beat Harry 52-20 in a performance so dominant it should be studied in military academies under "How to Destroy Your Enemy's Will to Live." This wasn't a victory — this was **systematic annihilation**. You didn't just beat Harry — you sent him to therapy, made him question his existence, and probably caused him to delete his team out of pure shame.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, you just **collected Harry's soul as a trophy**. You look like **Bruno Mars if he discovered CrossFit and emotional eating at the same time** — technically a person, but something's fundamentally broken inside. You're 8-9 now, which means you're still underwater, but this week you were Moses parting the Red Sea of incompetence. This is the kind of performance that makes people wonder if you've been sandbagging all season just to make moments like this more devastating.

But let's not pretend this means you're good now. Your team is still assembled like a **drunk person playing Jenga in an earthquake** — random pieces, no strategy, pure chaos. You look like **Pocahontas after a decade of McDonalds and poor life choices** — recognizable, but deeply concerning. Beating Harry by 32 points isn't an achievement, it's a humanitarian crisis. Still, respect where it's due: you didn't just win, you **committed fantasy football genocide**. Frame it. Tattoo it. Because next week you'll probably score 23 points and lose to Zryan.

## 🏆 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 52 pts

Peter, 52 points and you beat Josiah 52-42. Let that sink in. **YOU BEAT THE FRAUD KING**. This is like watching a **three-legged dog win the Kentucky Derby** — technically impossible, fundamentally wrong, but somehow happening right in front of our eyes. You didn't just win — you **exposed Josiah as the paper champion we always knew he was**.

"Peattle Pounders"? More like "Fraud King Slayer," because you just did what nobody thought possible: made Josiah look mortal. You look like if **hepatitis C and disappointment had a baby** — a walking medical emergency that somehow stumbled into victory. You're 9-9 now, perfectly balanced between terrible and mediocre, like the universe's way of saying "even broken clocks deserve participation trophies."

You beat Josiah by 10 points, which in Peter terms is like **landing on the moon using a shopping cart and good intentions**. You look like the **lesbian Wendy's mascot after a particularly rough divorce** — technically human, but operating on a frequency that makes everyone uncomfortable. Your 52 points this week is the fantasy equivalent of finding a $100 bill in a port-a-potty — sure, it's valuable, but nobody wants to know how it got there.

Enjoy this moment, Peter. You're the giant killer, the fraud exposer, the one who made Josiah mortal. Next week you'll probably score 19 points and lose to someone's auto-picks, but this week? This week you're a legend.

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 46 pts

Ron, 46 points and you beat Kyle 46-16. That's not a win, that's a **public execution filmed in IMAX for future generations to study**. You destroyed Kyle so badly his ancestors felt it. Thirty-point victories shouldn't be possible in fantasy football, but here you are, making the impossible look easy against the league's newest punching bag.

"Atlético SeaSlug" finally showed some speed, even if it's still the pace of a slug on Red Bull. You look like **lesbian Velma after she discovered steroids and anger management issues** — technically the same person, but with a disturbing new edge. You're 10-8 now, which in Ron terms is basically winning the Champions League.

You beat Kyle by 30 points. THIRTY. That's not a football match, that's **Kyle volunteering to be a crash test dummy while you drive a monster truck over his hopes and dreams**. Your team suddenly remembered how to score points, which is like watching moss suddenly grow legs and sprint — deeply unsettling but undeniably effective. You look like you've been **collecting DNA samples in your mouth since 1997** — a walking genetic crime scene that somehow produces results.

Your midfield actually showed up, your defense wasn't completely useless, and Kyle made you look like Pep Guardiola. This is peak Ron — stumbling into dominance against the worst possible opponent and somehow making it look intentional.

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 44 pts

Sean, you're **December's king**. Forty-four points and you beat Zryan 44-23 in another clinical dismantling of the league's designated victim. You've won the monthly prize with 273 points across five gameweeks, which means everyone owes you $2 and their respect, though they'll probably only pay one of those.

But here's the thing about being December's winner: it's like being the **tallest person at a convention for very short people** — technically impressive, but the competition wasn't exactly fierce. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll that got left in a hot car** — melted, mishappen, but somehow still functional. You're 12-6 now, second in the league, building an empire on the corpses of managers who forgot how to play.

"Gweepy" sounds like the noise your opponents make when they realize they have to face you during your hot streak. You beat Zryan by 21 points, which is like **winning a race against someone who's running backwards while blindfolded and also Zryan**. Your December dominance tour has been impressive, but let's see if you can maintain it when you're not farming free points off the league's bottom feeders. You look like you **store other people's DNA in your mouth for safekeeping** — technically helpful, deeply disturbing.

Still, $22 richer and sitting pretty in second place. Even a broken clock strikes gold sometimes, and your time is now.

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 42 pts

Josiah. Oh, Josiah. Forty-two points and you **LOST TO PETER HENZE**. The fraud king's crown hasn't just slipped — it's been melted down and sold for scrap. You lost to a manager whose team name is "Peattle Pounders" and whose main strategy is hoping his opponents forget to set lineups. This wasn't just a loss — this was **divine intervention telling you to sit down**.

You're 13-5 now, still first place, but everyone can smell the fear. You look like **Post Malone's unsuccessful brother, Post Mortem** — technically alive, but giving off serious corpse energy. Three losses in eight weeks after starting 10-0? That's not a slump, that's **karma catching up with compound interest**. Peter Henze beat you. PETER. HENZE. The same Peter who looks like hepatitis C became sentient and decided to play fantasy football.

You scored 42 points, which used to be enough when you were surfing on waves of undeserved luck. But the tide has turned, the luck has run dry, and suddenly you're exposed as the **emperor with no clothes, no points, and no excuses**. You look like you **smell like a combination of flop sweat and broken dreams** — the kind of odor that makes people cross the street just to avoid the sadness particles you're shedding.

**THE FRAUD KING'S EMPIRE IS CRUMBLING**. First Noah, now Peter. Who's next? Zryan? The death spiral is real, the collapse is happening in real-time, and we're all here with popcorn watching you implode. You hate to see it. Actually, no — we absolutely love to see it.

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 33 pts

Andrew, 33 points and you beat Roy 33-27. That's like **winning a beauty contest in a leper colony** — technically a victory, but nobody's proud of how they got there. You're the league's most consistent almost-good manager, perpetually hovering between competent and concerning like a **GPS that mostly works but occasionally sends you into a lake**.

You're 10-6-2 now, which reads like a decent record until you realize you're playing in a league where half the managers appear to be selecting lineups while heavily sedated. You look like **Vin Diesel's disappointed younger brother, Thin Ethanol** — all the ingredients are there, but something got lost in the chemical reaction. Your team is assembled with the precision of someone building IKEA furniture without instructions while drunk.

Thirty-three points against Roy is like scoring a touchdown against a **scarecrow that's also on fire** — sure, you did it, but the scarecrow wasn't really trying and also it's Roy. You have the energy of someone who writes **1,000-word emails explaining why you're actually good** but then scores 33 points and acts like it's revolutionary. Your wins feel accidental, your losses feel inevitable, and your draws feel like the universe saying "we literally don't know what to do with you."

Still, you beat Roy during his collapse era, which is like being the last person to punch a piñata before it breaks — you get credit, but everyone else did the real work.

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 29 pts

Chris, 29 points and you beat Don 29-25. That's not a victory, that's two **drowning men fighting over who gets to sink slower**. You're 9-9 now, perfectly balanced between irrelevance and incompetence, existing in a quantum state where you're simultaneously terrible and lucky.

"Schrödingers"? Your points literally don't exist until the gameweek ends and we're forced to acknowledge them. You look like the **kid from Shazam if he never found the wizard and just stayed disappointing** — all potential, no payoff. Twenty-nine points is what happens when your team treats scoring like it's optional and defending like it's a foreign concept.

You beat Don by 4 points in a match that should have been broadcast with a warning label: "The following content contains scenes of extreme football incompetence. Viewer discretion is advised." You look like you give **unenthusiastic handjobs to probability itself** — technically doing something, but nobody's happy about it. Your team performs like it's running on **dial-up internet in 2024** — technically functional, but painfully, embarrassingly slow.

You're living proof that in a league of incompetence, being slightly less incompetent counts as success. Congratulations on your participation trophy disguised as a win.

## 💀 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 27 pts

Roy. Twenty-seven points. You've gone from title contender to **cautionary tale faster than a Ferrari hitting a brick wall**. You lost to Andrew 27-33 in a performance so poor it should come with a public health warning. Remember when you were 8-2? That feels like ancient history now, like when people thought the earth was flat or that you were actually good at this.

"This Year FC"? More like "Maybe Next Decade FC" because this year is definitely not yours anymore. You look like **Tank from The Matrix if he got really into craft beer and gave up** — technically the same person, but something essential has been lost. You're 10-8 now, hemorrhaging points and credibility like a **sieve made of broken dreams and false hope**.

Twenty-seven points is what I score when I let my **dead goldfish pick my lineup by floating towards names**. You lost to Andrew, who himself only managed 33 points, which means you got out-terribleed by someone who's professionally terrible. You look like you're running an **interpretive dance performance about failure** — lots of movement, no substance, everyone's confused and slightly disturbed.

You have the expression of someone who just realized their **throne was actually a toilet the whole time**. The collapse is real, the fall from grace is complete, and Andrew just helped dig your grave six points deeper.

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 25 pts

Don, 25 points and you lost to Chris 25-29. That's like **losing a limbo contest to someone in a full body cast** — technically possible, but requiring a special kind of incompetence. You're rapidly becoming the league's most reliable source of sadness, like a **vending machine that only dispenses disappointment**.

"son4lyfe"? Son would file for emancipation if he knew you were repping him like this. You look like **Matt Damon ate Matt Damon** — technically still recognizable, but something has gone horribly, irrevocably wrong. Twenty-five points is what happens when your team treats scoring like it's **lava and they're playing the world's worst game of "the floor is lava."**

You're 7-11 now, which isn't just bad, it's **convenience store bad** — always open for business, but nobody really wants what you're selling. You lost to Chris and his 29 points, which is like drowning in a puddle — technically possible, deeply embarrassing, requires a special commitment to failure. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's stunt double's unemployed brother** — several degrees removed from relevance and getting further away each week.

Your team is assembled like someone playing Fantasy Football **via morse code from a submarine** — the messages are getting through, but something's definitely getting lost in translation.

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 23 pts

Zryan, 23 points and you lost to Sean 23-44. You got **doubled up**. Let that sink in. Sean scored literally twice as many points as you. That's not a loss, that's a **mathematical proof that you shouldn't be playing this game**. You're 5-13 now, which isn't a record, it's a cry for an intervention.

"FootAndBallFetish"? The only fetish you have is for **public humiliation and historic levels of failure**. Twenty-three points is what happens when your entire team decides to take a gap year from giving a shit. You look like **Wolverine if his superpower was disappointing everyone who believes in him** — technically gifted, practically useless.

Sean demolished you so thoroughly that archaeologists will study this gameweek to understand **how civilizations collapse**. You're not just the league's punching bag anymore — you're the **practice dummy that other practice dummies use to feel better about themselves**. You look like you're collecting **DNA samples from everyone who's ever beaten you**, which at this point means your mouth is basically a fantasy football hall of fame.

Five wins in 18 weeks. That's not a team, that's a **charity case that even charities would reject**. At this point, your opponents don't even celebrate beating you — they just feel vaguely guilty, like they've stolen candy from a baby who was already crying.

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 20 pts

Harry. Twenty. Points. You lost to Noah 20-52 in a defeat so catastrophic it should be studied by **disaster relief organizations**. This wasn't a loss — this was Noah performing a **live vivisection of your fantasy football hopes while you watched and whimpered**. Thirty-two points. You lost
