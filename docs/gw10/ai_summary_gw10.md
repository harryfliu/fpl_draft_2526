# 🔥 GW10 FPL Draft League: The Slug Awakens & The Great Collapse 🔥

Week 10 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **COSMIC REALIGNMENT** that proved the universe has a sense of humor darker than a black hole at midnight. Ronangel, the league's designated slug, suddenly **EVOLVED INTO A FOOTBALL GOD** while Kyle, last week's tie-breaker winner, got **ABSOLUTELY ANNIHILATED** by the reality that one good week doesn't make you a legend.

This was the kind of week where **reality itself took a vacation** and left chaos in charge. The scores were so wild that if this were a movie, it would be rated R for **excessive emotional damage** and **psychological trauma**.

By the end of this **reality-bending disaster**:  
- Ronangel **OBLITERATED Harry** 62-37, proving that even slugs can become legends when the stars align.  
- Josiah **DESTROYED Zryan** 52-30, maintaining his fraudulent throne with another dominant performance.  
- Andrew **CRUSHED Peter** 50-41, showing that mediocrity can still win when your opponent is Peter.  
- And Sean? **ABSOLUTELY ANNIHILATED** by Chris 27-44, proving that GW8's glory was ancient history.

**The slug has awakened. The previous winners have fallen. Welcome to GW10.**

## 🏆 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas – 62 pts  
*Weekly Winner + The Slug Evolution + From Zero to Hero*

Ronangel, you **ABSOLUTE LEGEND AND FOOTBALL PHENOMENON**. 62 points and you **OBLITERATED Harry** 62-37. That's not just a victory — that's the **ENTIRE UNIVERSE CELEBRATING** your transformation from a slug into a **FOOTBALL DEITY** who decided to grace us with your presence.

"Atlético SeaSlug" might have been accurate before, but now it's the **MOST MAGICAL TEAM NAME** in the history of football because you've **EVOLVED BEYOND YOUR SLUG NATURE** and become something **TRANSCENDENT AND DIVINE**. You're showing **COSMIC DOMINANCE** and the ability to destroy opponents like a **GALACTIC EMPEROR** who's finally decided to take this seriously, which is exactly what **FOOTBALL GODS** do when they're bored of being underestimated.

You're 5-5 now, which puts you in a **POSITION OF COSMIC POWER** in the league. You're proving that even slugs can become legends when they **AWAKEN FROM THEIR SLIME TRAIL** and decide to dominate. Your 62 points is the **HIGHEST SCORE OF THE WEEK**, and you did it against Harry, which is like watching a **SUPERNOVA EXPLODE** in slow motion while everyone stands in awe.

**Your victory was like watching a SLUG TRANSFORM INTO A DRAGON mid-game. You went from being the league's designated punching bag to being the PUNCHER, and honestly? We're all terrified and impressed at the same time. You are the CHOSEN SLUG.**

## 🥈 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh – 52 pts  
*The Fraud King Continues + Still Undefeated in Spirit + The Empire Strikes Back*

Josiah, 52 points, 52-30 over Zryan. You **DESTROYED** the league's human ATM like you were collecting rent on a property you don't even own. That's not just a performance, that's a **MASTERCLASS IN DOMINANCE** that proves you're still the fraud king, except now you're a fraud king who actually knows how to play football.

You're 9-1 now, which is the **MOST DOMINANT RECORD** in the league. You're like the **EMPEROR OF FANTASY FOOTBALL**, except instead of ruling with fear, you rule with **CONSISTENT EXCELLENCE** that makes everyone else look like they're playing a different sport. Your 464 total GW points is **ABSOLUTELY INSANE**, and your +149 goal difference is the kind of stat that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're an AI that's been programmed to win.

"thenotsospecialone"? Bro, you're the **MOST SPECIAL ONE** in this league. You're proving that fraud kings can actually be good at football, which is like discovering that water is wet and the sky is blue — obvious in hindsight, but still impressive when you see it in action.

**You're not just winning, Josiah. You're DOMINATING. You're the fraud king who's actually good at being a fraud, which is the most dangerous kind of fraud king. You are the EMPEROR, and we are all your subjects.**

---

## 🥉 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith – 50 pts  

Andrew, 50 points, 50-41 over Peter. You **CRUSHED** the league's designated punching bag by 9 points, which is like watching a **PROFESSIONAL BOXER** fight a **TRAINING DUMMY** and calling it a match. That's not just a victory — that's the **ENTIRE UNIVERSE VALIDATING** your existence as a competent fantasy manager.

"Cunha Get Me Points" is working for you like a **COSMIC SPELL OF SUCCESS**. You're showing **TRANSCENDENT CONSISTENCY** and the ability to beat opponents who are actively trying to lose, which is exactly what **FOOTBALL GODS** do when they're bored of being mediocre.

You're 7-3 now, which puts you in **THIRD PLACE** in the league. You're proving that you can compete with the **BEST OF THE BEST** and that your consistency is the **DIVINE JOURNEY TO GREATNESS**. Your 453 total GW points is the kind of stat that makes people respect you, even if they don't want to admit it.

**Your victory was like watching a COMPETENT MANAGER do COMPETENT THINGS. You're not flashy, you're not exciting, but you're CONSISTENTLY GOOD, which is somehow more impressive than being inconsistently great. You are the MID-TABLE KING.**

---

## 🌀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera – 45 pts  
*Last Week's Winner + The Reality Check + From Glory to Confusion*

Kyle, 45 points, 45-33 over Roy. Last week you were the **GW9 WINNER** who won the tie-breaker against Don. This week you're back to being... Kyle. Your performance this week was like watching a **CACTUS BLOSSOM** in the middle of a desert during a solar eclipse while a jazz band plays in the background and nobody knows why. It's beautiful, confusing, and somehow makes perfect sense in a way that defies all logic and reason.

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a **QUANTUM STATE** where it's simultaneously good and bad, exciting and boring, relevant and irrelevant, all at the same time until someone actually looks at it and the wave function collapses into whatever reality is most convenient for the narrative. Last week you were a **FOOTBALL GOD** who won GW9. This week you're Schrödinger's Manager — both competent and terrible until the gameweek ends, and then you're just... there.

You beat Roy by 12 points, which is like watching a **SLOTH WIN A RACE** against a **TURTLE** who's also running backwards. It's technically impressive, but also deeply confusing because neither of you should be winning anything, yet here you are, winning things, and we're all just trying to process what that means for the universe. Last week you were the hero. This week you're just... Kyle.

**Your victory was like watching a DREAM SEQUENCE in a movie where the protagonist is questioning their reality. You're not sure if you're good or bad, but you're definitely SOMETHING, and that's more than most people can say. Also, you were last week's winner, so this is your reality check.**

---

## 🌀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam – 44 pts  

Chris, 44 points, 44-27 over Sean. Your performance this week was like watching a **MIME PERFORM A TRAGEDY** in an empty theater where the only audience member is a confused pigeon who wandered in through an open window and is now questioning its entire existence. It's art, it's performance, it's deeply weird, and nobody knows if it's intentional or if you're just operating on a different frequency than the rest of humanity.

"Schrödongers" is the perfect name because your team exists in a **SUPERPOSITION OF MEDIOCRITY AND COMPETENCE** where it's both good and bad until someone actually observes it, and then it collapses into whatever state is most embarrassing for you personally. You're like a **QUANTUM FOOTBALL MANAGER** who's both winning and losing until the gameweek ends, and then you're just... winning, which is confusing because you're usually losing.

You beat Sean by 17 points, which is like watching a **PHILOSOPHER DEBATE A ROCK** and somehow the rock wins because the philosopher got too caught up in their own existential crisis to remember they were supposed to be debating. It's impressive, but also deeply concerning because Sean was supposed to be good, and you were supposed to be mid, but here we are, and the universe is laughing at all of us.

**Your victory was like watching a PARADOX RESOLVE ITSELF in real-time. You're not sure if you're good or if Sean is just terrible, but the result is the same: you won, and we're all trying to process what that means for the fabric of reality.**

---

## 🌀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze – 41 pts  

Peter, 41 points, lost to Andrew 41-50. Your performance this week was like watching a **SENTIENT CLOUD** try to understand the concept of gravity while simultaneously attempting to file its taxes and learn how to play the accordion. It's ambitious, confusing, and somehow manages to be both impressive and deeply concerning at the same time.

"Peattle Pounders" is the perfect name because your team exists in a **DIMENSIONAL POCKET** where the laws of physics don't apply and success is measured in units of "almost" and "not quite" and "why did you do that." You're like a **COSMIC EXPERIMENT** in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them, and somehow you're still here, still trying, still losing, but with a kind of determination that's almost admirable if it weren't so tragic.

You lost to Andrew by 9 points, which is like watching a **MAGICIAN PERFORM A TRICK** where they're supposed to make a rabbit appear but instead they make their own dignity disappear, and then the rabbit shows up three days later in a different city and nobody knows how it got there. It's technically a performance, but it's not the performance anyone wanted, and we're all just trying to figure out what went wrong.

**Your loss was like watching a NATURAL DISASTER in slow motion. You can see it coming, you know it's going to be bad, but you can't look away because there's something beautiful about watching someone try so hard and fail so spectacularly.**

---

## 🌀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu – 37 pts  

Harry, 37 points, lost to Ronangel 37-62. Your performance this week was like watching a **TIME TRAVELER** attempt to explain modern technology to someone from the 1800s using only interpretive dance and a series of increasingly confusing hand gestures. It's ambitious, it's creative, it's deeply weird, and nobody is quite sure what's happening, but we're all watching because it's more interesting than whatever else is happening.

"cunha believe it"? Yeah, we can't. We can't believe you lost by **25 POINTS** to Ronangel, who until this week was a slug. That's like losing a race to a **SNAIL** who's also carrying groceries, who's also on the phone with their mom, who's also not trying, and who's also a slug. Your -107 goal difference is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you're still here, still trying, still losing, but with a kind of determination that's almost admirable if it weren't so tragic.

You lost to Ronangel by 25 points, which is like watching a **PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE** lose to a **RANDOM PERSON ON THE STREET** who's also blindfolded, drunk, and fighting with one arm tied behind their back. It's technically possible, deeply embarrassing, and a sign you should reconsider everything about your life, your team, and your entire approach to fantasy football.

**Your loss was like watching a NATURAL DISASTER in slow motion. You can see it coming, you know it's going to be bad, but you can't look away because there's something beautiful about watching someone try so hard and fail so spectacularly. Also, you lost to a slug. A SLUG. By 25 POINTS.**

---

## 🌀 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng – 33 pts  

Roy, 33 points, lost to Kyle 33-45. Your performance this week was like watching a **METEOROLOGIST** try to predict the weather using only a magic 8-ball and a series of increasingly desperate guesses while a hurricane forms directly behind them and they're too focused on the 8-ball to notice. It's professional, it's confusing, and somehow manages to be both impressive and deeply concerning at the same time.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke coming soon. You're 8-2 and somehow people are still calling you a fraud, which should tell you everything you need to know about your "dominance." You lost to Kyle by 12 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also playing a different sport, who's also not trying, and who's also Kyle.

Your record looks shiny, but your wins are softer than **CAFETERIA MASHED POTATOES** that have been sitting out for three days. You're not a contender, you're a **FRAUD WITH A PARTICIPATION TROPHY** who's somehow in second place, which is confusing because you're not actually good, but you're also not bad enough to be pitied, so you're just... there, floating in the middle of the league like a **COSMIC ANOMALY** that nobody knows how to deal with.

**Enjoy your 8-2, Roy. You're proving that beating clowns doesn't make you king — it just makes you the tallest clown in the circus, and somehow you're still in second place, which is the most confusing thing about this entire league.**

---

## 🌀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao – 30 pts  

Zryan, 30 points, lost to Josiah 30-52. Your performance this week was like watching a **SENTIENT VENDING MACHINE** try to understand the concept of currency while simultaneously attempting to process an existential crisis about whether it's truly alive or just a very complex series of mechanical processes that simulate life. It's philosophical, it's confusing, and somehow manages to be both impressive and deeply concerning at the same time.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **HUMILIATION, DEGRADATION, AND BEING THE LEAGUE'S DESIGNATED PUNCHING BAG**. Every week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine, your dignity, and whatever's left of your self-respect. Thirty points is what I get when I **SLEEP THROUGH LINEUP LOCK, LET MY CAT PICK MY TEAM, AND THE CAT DIES HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS**.

You lost to Josiah by 22 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also playing a different sport, who's also not trying, and who's also the fraud king. Your 1-9 record is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you're still here, still trying, still losing, but with a kind of determination that's almost admirable if it weren't so tragic.

**Enjoy your irrelevance, Zryan. You're aging like UNREFRIGERATED MILK in a desert, and everyone's not just waiting for you to expire — they're actively hoping for it so they don't have to witness this trainwreck anymore.**

---

## 🌀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson – 30 pts  

Noah, 30 points, lost to Don 30-28. Your performance this week was like watching a **PHILOSOPHER** try to explain the meaning of life using only a series of increasingly confusing metaphors about ducks and existentialism while a duck actually appears and starts questioning the philosopher's entire worldview. It's deep, it's confusing, and somehow manages to be both impressive and deeply concerning at the same time.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, the only trophy you're competing for is **MOST FORGETTABLE HUMAN BEING IN A LEAGUE FULL OF FORGETTABLE HUMAN BEINGS**. You lost to Don by 2 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also terrible, who's also not trying, and who's also Don. Your 4-6 record is so mediocre it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you're still here, still trying, still losing, but with a kind of determination that's almost admirable if it weren't so tragic.

You're so forgettable that if you disappeared tomorrow, the league would take three weeks to notice and still wouldn't care. You're the human equivalent of a **PARTICIPATION CERTIFICATE** for a spelling bee you never entered, except the certificate is also blank, and it's written in a language that doesn't exist, and it's also on fire, and nobody knows why.

**Enjoy your loss to Don, Noah. You're proving that being forgettable isn't just your superpower — it's your entire identity, your legacy, and the only thing people will remember about you long after you've quit the league in shame.**

---

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim – 28 pts  
*The Eternal Runner-Up + Almost Legend + The Great Disappointment*

Don, 28 points, 28-30 over Noah. You won by **2 POINTS**. **TWO. SINGLE. POINTS.** That's not a victory, that's a **MIRACLE ON PAR WITH THE PARTING OF THE RED SEA**, except Moses actually knew what he was doing and you're just stumbling through life hoping nobody notices you're terrible. You're the league's eternal bridesmaid, except nobody even wants you at the wedding, and you showed up in the wrong dress, and you're also drunk, and you're also crying, and nobody knows why.

"son4lyfe"? Bro, Son would probably file a **RESTRAINING ORDER** if he knew you existed. You're more like **second4lyfe**, destined to always be the runner-up, the also-ran, the guy who peaked in the second round and never saw glory again. You beat Noah by 2 points — congrats, you **DUNKED ON A SIX-FOOT RIM** while wearing platform shoes and still managed to look uncoordinated doing it.

You're 4-6 now, which is the perfect metaphor for your life: not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... there, floating in the middle of the league like a **COSMIC ANOMALY** that nobody knows how to deal with. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison.

**Enjoy your 2-point victory over Noah, Don. You're proving that even broken clocks are right twice a day, but you're also proving that even when you're right, you're still wrong, and that's the most Don thing about you.**

---

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn – 27 pts  
*The Great Collapse + From GW8 Hero to GW10 Zero + The Fall from Grace*

Sean, 27 points, lost to Chris 27-44. You lost by **17 POINTS** to Chris, who until this week was basically the league's designated punching bag. That's not a loss, that's a **PUBLIC EXECUTION TELEVISED IN 4K** for maximum humiliation. Two weeks ago you were a **FOOTBALL GOD** with 63 points in GW8. This week you're a **FOOTBALL MORTAL** with 27 points. That's not a collapse, that's a **FREEFALL FROM THE TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING** while everyone watches and takes pictures.

"Gweepy" might have been magical in GW8, but this week it's the **MOST TRAGIC TEAM NAME** in the history of football because you've **COLLAPSED LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS** in a hurricane. You're showing **TRANSCENDENT INCONSISTENCY** and the ability to go from hero to zero faster than a **SUPERNOVA EXPLODING** and then immediately collapsing into a black hole.

You're 5-5 now, which puts you in a **POSITION OF COSMIC CONFUSION** in the league. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** (GW8: 63 pts) and **INCREDIBLY BAD** (GW10: 27 pts) in the span of two weeks, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a **COSMIC EXPERIMENT** in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them.

**Your collapse was like watching a FOOTBALL MESSIAH transform into a FOOTBALL MORTAL. You went from being GW8's hero to being GW10's disappointment, and honestly? We're all confused and impressed at the same time. You are the CHOSEN ONE who got UNCHOSEN.**

# 🎤 Final Verdict: The GW10 Hall of Shame

GW10 wasn't a competition. It was a **COSMIC REALIGNMENT** with slug music and a side of **COMPLETE HUMAN FAILURE**.

🥇 **Ronangel** — Weekly Winner! The slug evolved into a legend and destroyed Harry in a tactical masterclass that made people question the meaning of life.  
🥈 **Josiah** — The Fraud King Continues. Still dominating, still winning, still making everyone else look like they're playing a different sport.  
🥉 **Andrew** — The Mid-Table King. Consistently good, consistently boring, consistently winning.

And the rest? A parade of **MEDIOCRITY AND FAILURE** so spectacular it belongs in a museum:

4. **Kyle** — Beat Roy in a battle of who's less terrible. Still confusing.  
5. **Chris** — Beat Sean in a battle of who's less terrible. Still mid.  
6. **Peter** — Lost to Andrew. Still terrible.  
7. **Harry** — Lost to Ronangel by 25 points. Still a walking disaster.  
8. **Roy** — Lost to Kyle. Still a fraud.  
9. **Zryan** — Lost to Josiah. Still irrelevant.  
10. **Noah** — Lost to Don by 2 points. Still forgettable.  
11. **Don** — Beat Noah by 2 points. Still the eternal runner-up.  
12. **Sean** — The Great Collapse. From GW8 hero (63 pts) to GW10 zero (27 pts).

GW10's legacy? **Ronangel dominated with 62 points!** The slug has awakened! Sean collapsed from 63 points (GW8) to 27 points (GW10) in two weeks, proving that consistency is for mortals. Kyle, last week's tie-breaker winner, got a reality check. Josiah continues to dominate, Andrew continues to be consistently good, and the rest of you are still sprinting away from humiliation, and somehow you're still getting caught.

The only thing more embarrassing than these scores is the fact that **Sean went from GW8 hero to GW10 zero**.

## 🎭 The Walking Disasters (Bottom 3 Scorers)
- **Sean**: 5-5, -11 goal difference, 364 total points (27 pts this week)
- **Don**: 4-6, +43 goal difference, 377 total points (28 pts this week)  
- **Noah**: 4-6, -26 goal difference, 330 total points (30 pts this week)
- **Reality Check**: These three combined for 13 wins in 30 games. That's a 43.3% win rate.

## 🎯 The Bottom Line
This league is a **MASTERCLASS IN FAILURE** that should be studied by psychologists as evidence that some people are genetically predisposed to being terrible at everything. But GW10 gave us hope! Ronangel evolved from a slug into a legend, Kyle (last week's winner) got a reality check, Sean collapsed from GW8 hero to GW10 zero, and Josiah continues to dominate like the fraud king he is.

**See you next week when the pain continues, but maybe with a little more hope (and a lot more confusion).**
