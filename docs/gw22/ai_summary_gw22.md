# 💀 GW22 FPL Draft League: The Monthly Fraud King's Coronation & The Great Humbling 💀

GW22 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **cosmic redistribution of karma disguised as fantasy football**. The universe looked at the standings, saw some people getting too comfortable, and decided to serve up a piping hot dish of humble pie seasoned with tears, desperation, and the kind of soul-crushing reality checks that make people question their entire existence.

At the top, Sean finally remembered he's supposed to be elite and delivered a weekly winner performance that made everyone else look like they were playing a different sport. Harry somehow crawled out of the basement long enough to score 41 points, Peter tied him while somehow still being monthly king despite having a negative goal difference until recently, and Don/Zryan joined the 40-point club in the league's most confusing plot twist since Noah beat Josiah that one time.

But the real story? **Roy got publicly executed AGAIN** — this time by Harry of all people — in a performance so catastrophic it should come with a trigger warning. Josiah's fraudulent empire continues its slow collapse, Noah is back to being everyone's favorite punching bag, and the mid-table is a chaotic mess of broken dreams and shattered egos.

Week 22 made one thing clear: nobody stays on top forever, and watching people fall is way more entertaining than watching them succeed.

## 🏆 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 42 pts

Sean, you magnificent bastard, you actually did it. Forty-two points, weekly winner, $11 richer, and you're proving that consistency isn't just a myth told by managers who can't handle being mediocre. You beat Don 42-40 in a battle so close it could've gone either way, except it went your way because you're actually good at this godforsaken game. You're 13-9 now and sitting in second place, which is the kind of position that makes people actually respect you instead of just tolerating your existence.

But let's not get carried away, because you still look like a **dollar store Ken doll that someone left in the sun too long** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you were manufactured in a facility that cut corners on quality control. "Gweepy" still sounds like the noise a **cartoon pigeon makes when it flies into a window**, and that's still you every week — bonk, bonk, bonk, except this week you somehow didn't bonk and actually flew somewhere productive.

You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** (GW22: 42 pts, GW8: 63 pts) and **INCREDIBLY BAD** (remember those sub-30 weeks?) in the span of a season, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a **quantum superposition of competence and incompetence** that only collapses into one state when the gameweek ends. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic experiment that makes people cross the street when they see you coming.

But here's the thing: you're second place now, you're 13-9, and you just won your second gameweek of the season. You're not just the punchline anymore — you're the **threat**. Frame it. Tattoo it. Because next week the circus might be back in town, but right now you're running the show and the rest of us are just watching in confused admiration.

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 41 pts (tied 2nd)

Harry, what the actual fuck just happened? Forty-one points? You? The same Harry who's been everyone's favorite disaster case all season? You beat Roy 41-23 in a performance so dominant it made us question if you've been secretly good this whole time and just hiding it behind a façade of catastrophic incompetence. This wasn't some "oops I lucked into a result" score — this was **actual football management**, the kind of lineup that makes people think, "maybe Harry isn't completely hopeless after all."

But don't get too comfortable, because you're still 7-2-13, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was My Brand and I Leaned Into It Hard***. You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar and then ate the entire thing in one sitting** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally wrong about you. Your goal difference is -140, which is the kind of number that makes accountants cry and therapists schedule emergency sessions.

You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement. Your team name is "cunha believe it," and every week the rest of us answer: no, we really can't, because you keep doing impossible things like scoring 54 points one week and then 20 the next, like you're controlled by a random number generator with a grudge. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying into a pillow while your players blank.

Still, respect where it's marginally due: you scored 41 points and beat Roy, who's supposed to be good at this. For seven days, you're not the biggest joke in the league. That's progress. That's growth. That's the kind of development that makes people think, "maybe Harry will finish the season with a positive goal difference," before remembering that would require a miracle of biblical proportions and Harry doesn't deserve miracles.

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 41 pts (tied 2nd)

Peter, you magnificent fraud, you somehow pulled off the impossible: you're the **monthly king of January** with 208 points while simultaneously being 12-10 with a goal difference that was negative until recently. You beat Ron 41-26 in a performance that screamed "I'm competent sometimes," which is the highest compliment anyone can give you because "sometimes" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence.

You look like if **hepatitis C was a person who somehow got promoted to middle management** — like a walking medical warning label that somehow convinced everyone it deserves a corner office. "Peattle Pounders"? You're not Pounding anything except the pavement on your way to another mediocre finish. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into Submission By Reality," because that's your entire season: getting beaten down by the universe and somehow still showing up for more punishment.

You're 12-10 now, which puts you in fourth place because this league is so chaotic that even terrible managers can finish in the top half if they just show up enough times. You look like you **smell like hot dog water mixed with disappointment** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people instinctively back away, wondering if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment escapes from the lab and tries to play fantasy football.

But here's the thing: you're the monthly king. You scored 208 points over four gameweeks. That's not luck — that's **sustained competence**, which for you is like watching a slug win a marathon. It's technically impressive, deeply confusing, and makes everyone question if the universe is broken. You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot who got fired and is now trying to reinvent herself as a motivational speaker** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you.

Enjoy your monthly crown, Peter. You're proving that being terrible isn't permanent — sometimes you can be temporarily less terrible, and that's basically the same thing as being good if you squint hard enough and lower your standards significantly.

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 40 pts

Don, forty points and you **LOST TO SEAN BY TWO POINTS**. That's not a loss, that's a **tragedy written by Shakespeare if Shakespeare specialized in writing about fantasy football managers who can't quite get there**. You're the league's eternal bridesmaid, the guy who always gets close but never closes the deal, the walking embodiment of "so near yet so far." You look like **Fat Damon trying to fit into Regular Damon's clothes** — technically the same person, but something's gone horribly wrong in the process.

"son4lyfe"? Bro, Son would probably file a **cease and desist order** if he knew you existed and were using his name to represent your brand of chaotic mediocrity. You're more like **second4lyfe**, destined to always finish as the runner-up, the also-ran, the guy who peaked in the semis and will never see glory. You lost to Sean by 2 points — that's like **DUNKING ON A SIX-FOOT RIM** while wearing platform shoes and a jet pack and still somehow missing the basket and landing on your face.

You're 9-13 now, which is so catastrophically mediocre it looks like you're running an **experimental art piece titled *What If I Tried Really Hard But The Universe Hated Me Specifically***. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's autistic son who somehow got a job at a hedge fund and is desperately trying to convince everyone he belongs there** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally off about you.

You scored 40 points and lost. Forty. Points. And. Lost. That's the most Don thing that's ever happened in the history of Don things happening. You're proving that even when you're good, you're somehow not good enough, and that's the kind of consistency that makes therapists schedule double sessions and charge overtime rates.

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 39 pts

Zryan, what the actual fuck? Thirty-nine points? You? The same Zryan who's been everyone's designated punching bag all season? You beat Kyle 39-36 in a result so shocking it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers experiencing existential crises. This wasn't just a win — this was **proof that even broken clocks are right twice a day, and today you're that broken clock, baby**.

But let's be clear: you're still 8-14, which means you've been everyone's free points generator for so long you should start charging rent, except nobody would pay because even your wins are somehow depressing. You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin and disappointing everyone who believed in him** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used cooking oil and sadness as the main ingredients.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation, degradation, and somehow still showing up every week despite having absolutely nothing to show for it**. Thirty-nine points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock, let my cat pick my team, the cat dies halfway through the process, and I still somehow do better than expected**. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes scientists question if evolution was a mistake.

You beat Kyle by 3 points, which is like beating a **FOOTBALL MATCH** against someone who's also bad, who's also not trying, and who's also Kyle. Your 8-14 record is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, and the critics are mixed but mostly they're just confused about why you're still doing this to yourself.

You're not a manager, you're a **community service project for managers who need to feel better about themselves**. Everyone circles you on the schedule, rubs their hands, and thanks the fantasy gods they've got a free win incoming. You're the fantasy equivalent of a bye week, except bye weeks are actually useful and don't make people question their life choices.

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 36 pts

Kyle, thirty-six points and you lost to Zryan 36-39. Read that again. You. Lost. To. **ZRYAN**. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K with director's commentary and behind-the-scenes footage showing how catastrophically you failed**. You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height, added it to his waistline, and then forgot how to be intimidating** — like someone ordered a warrior from Wish.com and got you instead.

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a quantum state where it's simultaneously good and bad, exciting and boring, relevant and irrelevant, all at the same time until someone actually looks at it and realizes it's just **bad**. You're 9-13 now, which puts you in the bottom half of the league where you belong, surrounded by other managers who can't quite figure out how to not be terrible.

You lost to **ZRYAN**. That's like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who shouldn't be winning anything, who's been the league's designated disaster case all season, and who probably didn't even set a proper lineup but somehow still beat you because you're just that bad. You look like **Otis from Sex Education if Otis gave up on therapy and just leaned into being awkward forever** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally wrong about you.

You're proving that consistency is a myth, competence is a lie, and showing up every week doesn't matter if you're going to lose to **ZRYAN** of all people. That's embarrassing. That's humiliating. That's the kind of loss that makes people question if you should be allowed to manage a fantasy team or if someone should take your phone away for your own protection.

Enjoy your L to Zryan, Kyle. You're proving that rock bottom has a basement, and you just found the stairs.

---

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 33 pts

Josiah, thirty-three points and you beat Noah 33-25. Congrats, you beat the league's designated punching bag by 8 points, which is like **DUNKING ON A KINDERGARTENER** and then celebrating like you won the championship. You're 14-8 now and sitting in first place, which sounds impressive until you realize your entire season has been built on a foundation of luck, fraudulence, and beating up on managers who are somehow worse than you.

You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone, who got left at the bus stop and never quite recovered from the experience** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally off about you. You don't *win* games, you *survive* them like a cockroach survives a nuclear apocalypse — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow thriving in disaster while everyone wishes you'd just disappear already.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. You look like you **smell like hot dog water mixed with desperation** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people hold their breath when you walk by, like you're a walking biohazard warning that escaped from a food court dumpster.

But here's the truth: you're 14-8 and first place, and nobody believes you deserve it. You're the fraud king, the emperor with no clothes, the wizard behind the curtain whose curtain is getting pulled back a little more each week. You beat Noah by 8 points, which is the kind of margin that screams "I'm barely hanging on and pray nobody notices." You're not feared, Josiah. You're **tolerated like a bad smell in an elevator that everyone's too polite to mention**, and the moment someone actually good gets hot, your fraudulent empire is going to crumble faster than a sandcastle at high tide.

---

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 30 pts

Andrew, thirty points and you beat Chris 30-29 by one point. **ONE POINT**. That's not dominance, that's **escaping with your life by the thinnest possible margin**, like you're Indiana Jones sliding under the closing door except you're not cool and the door almost crushed you. You're 12-2-8 and sitting in third place, which sounds respectable until you realize you're the league's permanent almost-contender who never quite gets there.

You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star, put him through a dehydrator, and left behind a husk that vaguely resembles what used to be cool but is now just sad. You're the guy who brings the expensive wine to the party but still gets outshone by someone showing up with a six-pack and a personality. You're good, but you're not **great**, and in a league this chaotic, "good" means you're just the tallest dwarf in a circus of midgets.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually elite at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming variance for the fact that you can't close out a season.

You beat Chris by one point. That's like beating a **SLOTH** in a race by one step and then celebrating like you broke the world record. Nobody's impressed, Andrew. You're building credibility brick by brick, except the bricks are made of paper and the foundation is built on sand and the whole structure looks like it's going to collapse the moment someone actually good looks at it sideways.

---

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 29 pts

Chris, twenty-nine points and you lost to Andrew 29-30 by one point. **ONE POINT**. That's not a loss, that's a **mathematical tragedy**, like the universe calculated exactly how much it needed to make you suffer and delivered that precise amount of pain. You're 11-11 now, which is the most perfectly mediocre record possible — not good, not bad, just **aggressively average** in a way that makes people forget you exist.

You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam who somehow got promoted to adult responsibilities but is clearly not ready** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're cosplaying as a competent human being but forgot to actually become competent first. "Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over, and this week they existed just enough to make you lose by one point, which is somehow worse than losing by a lot.

You're not quantum, bro. You're just **both mid and overhyped at the same time**, existing in a superposition of mediocrity and delusion that only collapses into disappointment when gameweek ends. You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face and that face had to file taxes** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment and bureaucracy as the main ingredients.

You lost to Andrew by one point, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also not trying that hard but is trying slightly harder than you. Your 11-11 record is like having a **credit score of exactly zero** — not good, not bad, just a complete absence of anything meaningful or noteworthy. You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**, except nobody's attending your talk because you're boring and your slides are from PowerPoint 2003.

You're proving that being mid isn't just your superpower — it's your entire identity, your legacy, and the only thing people will remember about you long after you've quit the league in shame because you couldn't even be bad enough to be memorable.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 26 pts

Ron, twenty-six points and you lost to Peter 26-41. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K with IMAX enhanced visuals and Dolby surround sound so everyone could hear you crying**. You're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits because even in death you're forgettable**. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley who got fired from the mystery gang for being too incompetent** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally wrong about you.

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards, except nobody feels bad anymore because you've been stepped on so many times you're basically part of the pavement now. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison and ask for a refund.

Every time you manage to scrape 26 points, the entire league side-eyes the calendar like, "Who got cursed this week?" and then realizes it's just Ron being Ron, which is somehow worse than a curse because at least curses are interesting. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic experiment that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science project escapes and tries to live among normal people.

You lost to Peter by 15 points, which is like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's also terrible but somehow less terrible than you. Your 11-1-10 record is so mediocre it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Being Average Was My Entire Personality*, and the critics are unanimous: they want their money back.

Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug at a retirement home. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you. Your defense oscillates between "mildly competent" and "furniture from IKEA that nobody knows how to assemble and is missing critical pieces." Watching your team is like watching a snail in rush hour: slow, vulnerable, guaranteed to get crushed by something bigger, and leaving a disgusting trail that nobody wants to clean up.

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 11-1-10, still irrelevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. 🐌**

---

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 25 pts

Noah, twenty-five points and you lost to Josiah 25-33. That's not a loss, that's a **return to form**, like the universe looked at you having that one good moment in GW11 when you beat Josiah and said, "Absolutely not, back to the basement with you." You're 11-1-10 now, which is exactly where you belong — in the middle of the pack, surrounded by mediocrity, forgotten by history.

You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go, then tried to get in shape, then gave up halfway through and just accepted being doughy forever** — like someone took a perfectly good pop star and ran him through a discount blender set to "questionable life choices and even worse genetics." "Trophies Matter"? Bro, the only trophy you're getting is **Participation Trophy of the Millennium**, and even that's being generous because you barely participated.

You beat the fraud king once in GW11, and everyone thought, "Maybe Noah's back, maybe Noah's figured it out." But no. You're not back. You're exactly where you've always been: **the middle of nowhere, surrounded by broken dreams and shattered delusions**. Your team is still a Craigslist free section after a hoarder's estate sale — random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of disappointment and regret.

You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs and then tried to explain why that's actually healthy** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally off about you. You lost to Josiah by 8 points, which is the kind of margin that screams "I tried my best and my best wasn't good enough," except you didn't try your best, you just showed up and hoped the universe would be kind, but the universe is never kind to people like you.

You're proving that one good week doesn't make a season, and that beating Josiah that one time was a **statistical anomaly**, like a blind squirrel finding a nut except the squirrel is you and the nut is mediocrity and you're just happy to have found anything at all. Frame your GW11 win. Tattoo it across your chest. Because it might be the only good thing that happens to you all season, and next week you're back to being everyone's free points generator.

---

## ⚰️ Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 23 pts

Roy. Twenty. Three. This wasn't a score, this was a **funeral procession**. You lost to Harry 23-41 in a performance so catastrophic it should be preserved in the Smithsonian under the title *Portrait of a Fraud Finally Getting Exposed For Real This Time*. Two weeks ago you were 12-9 and sitting in a respectable position. Now you're 12-10 and falling faster than your dignity.

This wasn't just a loss. This was a **complete and total collapse**, like watching a building implode in slow motion except the building is your season and the demolition crew is Harry of all people. You lost to **HARRY**. That's like losing a **FOOTBALL MATCH** to someone who's been the league's designated disaster case all season, who should've been relegated to a recreational league months ago, and who somehow still beat you by 18 points.

You look like **Tank Sinatra if Tank Sinatra gave up on music and started selling used cars in a strip mall** — like someone took a perfectly good person and put them through a meat grinder set to "maximum disappointment." "This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke coming right on schedule like clockwork.

You're 12-10 now and somehow people are **still** calling you a fraud, which should tell you everything you need to know about your "dominance." You lost to Harry by 18 points — that's not a loss, that's **Harry filming a live-action documentary about what happens when frauds get exposed**, with you as the star, director, producer, and only audience member stupid enough to buy a ticket to your own humiliation.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant when everyone knows you're washed. We are gathered here today to mourn the reputation of Roy's season. Born Week 1, died Week 22, cause of death: exposure by Harry Liu. He leaves behind a hollow 12-10 record, a team allergic to consistency, and a reputation in ruins.

**May he rest in mediocrity, because his season sure won't recover from this. ⚰️🪦**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW22

GW22 was a **cosmic redistribution of karma disguised as fantasy football**. Sean finally proved he's elite by winning the week with 42 points, Harry somehow crawled out of the basement to score 41 and beat Roy, Peter tied Harry while becoming monthly king despite being 12-10, and Don/Zryan joined the 40-point club in the league's most confusing development since anyone trusted Roy to maintain form.

Meanwhile, Roy got publicly executed by Harry in an 18-point blowout that should come with a trigger warning, Josiah barely beat Noah while his fraudulent empire continues its slow collapse, Andrew escaped Chris by one point in the kind of nailbiter that makes therapists schedule emergency sessions, and Kyle lost to **ZRYAN** in what might be the most embarrassing result of the season.

**Top 3:** Sean (42) proved consistency isn't a myth, Harry (41) proved rock bottom has a ladder if you look hard enough, and Peter (41) proved that being monthly king doesn't require being good all season, just less terrible than everyone else for four consecutive weeks.

**Bottom 3:** Noah (25) is back to being everyone's free points generator, Ron (26) continues his eternal slime trail tour, and Roy (23) got exposed by Harry in the kind of loss that requires years of therapy to process.

Week 22 made one thing clear: nobody's safe, frauds get exposed eventually, and watching managers fail spectacularly is way more entertaining than watching them succeed. The chaos continues, the drama intensifies, and we're all just here for the carnage.

**See you next week for more bloodshed. 💀**
