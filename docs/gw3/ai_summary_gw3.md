# 💀 GW3 FPL Draft League: Slimy Wins, Venmo Debt, & Public Embarrassments 💀

Some of you came into GW3 thinking you were contenders. Others? You showed up like background NPCs, just here to make Chris richer. By the end of this week, luck was mistaken for skill, egos got inflated off pity wins, and at least one manager (Sean) should probably delete the app entirely.

Let’s break it all down.

---

## 🏆 Chris “Schrödongers” Duncam – 50 pts
Chris didn’t just win the week, he mugged Peter in broad daylight. **50–39** over the Peattle Pounders — that’s less a fantasy match and more a reminder that Peter built his team out of leftover IKEA parts. Chris strolls out with the weekly W, the monthly crown, and another **$11** in his already smug little pocket.  

But let’s be real: this wasn’t tactical genius. This was the footballing equivalent of finding a $20 bill on the sidewalk. Senesi suddenly playing like Cannavaro reborn? Chalobah and Lacroix turning into prime Sergio Ramos overnight? That’s not scouting, that’s divine intervention. Chris basically won because the FPL gods thought it would be funny.  

And the squad behind it all? A midfield full of NPCs, a forward line led by Chris Wood (aka “statue that occasionally heads a ball”), and enough deadweight to sink a cruise ship. Yet somehow this clown car of a roster keeps spitting out wins.  

Now he’s sitting on top of August with **147 points** total and half the league owing him money. The irony? He still owes Josiah and Kyle two bucks. Imagine being the “richest” guy in the league but also the one ducking Venmo requests like a shady Craigslist seller.  

So enjoy your $33, Chris. Because deep down, we all know the truth: your team isn’t built for glory, it’s built for humiliation — and when the collapse comes, it’s going to be so bad you’ll wish you never even joined this league.  

---

## 💀 Don “son4lyfe” Kim – 48 pts
Don finally picked up a win this week, squeaking past Ron in a **48–45** slugfest. Congrats, Don, you beat Atlético SeaSlug. That’s like bragging about winning a fistfight against a kid holding cotton candy. Nobody’s impressed.  

And let’s talk about your squad. Your bench looks like a graveyard, your midfield looks like a clearance rack, and your forward line? Mateta, Thiago, and Mayenda — that’s not a strike force, that’s a group project where everyone forgot to do the homework. You’ve got Bruno and Szoboszlai carrying your entire squad like pack mules, while the rest of your team contributes about as much as a traffic cone.  

Your transfer activity this week was chaos theatre. You basically traded players like a guy swapping Pokémon cards at recess: Mount in, Mount out, Zubimendi cameo, Tavernier denial… what are you even doing? You’ve got more churn than a butter factory, and the results look just as greasy.  

And the name *son4lyfe*? Don’t kid yourself — Son doesn’t even want to be in your squad. He saw your team sheet and filed for emancipation. You’re living off a Spurs player’s branding, but in reality you’re Tottenham without Kane: all hype, no trophies, zero hope.  

Here’s the cold truth: this week was your peak. Your “big” win over Ron is the high point of your season, and from here it’s downhill. When the history books are written, Don, your chapter will be titled: *“One lucky win, followed by 14 weeks of tears.”*  

And the worst part? Even after finally getting a W, the league still owes Chris money, not you. You’re a passenger in this league — and everyone knows it.  

---

## 💀 Ronangel “Atlético SeaSlug” Rojas – 45 pts
Ron, you put up **45 points** this week and still lost to Don. Don. That’s like losing a rap battle to Vanilla Ice. It’s not just embarrassing, it’s career-ending. You’re the kind of manager who shows up to a gunfight with a pool noodle and then acts surprised when you get lit up.  

Your squad? Let’s be real, it’s just vibes and prayers. Gyökeres, Raúl, and Füllkrug up front? That’s not a strike force, that’s the discount aisle at Ross. Watching your forwards is like watching three drunk dads trying to assemble IKEA furniture — clumsy, confused, and guaranteed to collapse.  

Your “bright spots” came from your defense, which makes sense because your team plays like a bus permanently parked in front of goal. Guéhi drops a miracle, Tosin chips in, Muñoz shows up — but let’s not pretend that was strategy. That was dumb luck. If your defenders don’t cosplay as prime Maldini every week, you’re dead.  

And let’s not gloss over the midfield. Grealish is the only player keeping your squad from being a full-time comedy sketch — and even he spends half his week hungover in Ibiza. Elanga? Caicedo? Gravenberch? This isn’t a midfield, this is the cast list for *Benchwarmers 2.*  

Atlético SeaSlug? Name checks out. Slow, spineless, and nobody cares if you get stepped on. You’re crawling through this season like a slug on hot pavement, leaving a slimy little trail of mediocrity behind you.  

The reality is brutal, Ron: if losing to Don is your storyline in August, your September is going to look like a funeral. And guess what? You’re the only one in the coffin. 🪦🐌  

---

## 💀 Josiah “thenotsospecialone” Loh – 40 pts
Josiah, you’re sitting at the top of the league with a perfect **3–0** record, but let’s be clear: you’re not dominating, you’re surviving. **40–37** over Andrew isn’t a win, it’s a pity party. That’s the fantasy equivalent of two drunk guys slapping each other outside a bar — technically someone wins, but everyone who watches just feels sad.  

Your team name is *thenotsospecialone*, and you nailed it. Because there’s nothing special about scraping by with João Pedro carrying you like a single dad on double shifts. The rest of your squad? Pure wallpaper. Gusto, Dalot, Spence, Mitchell — congratulations, you’ve built an entire backline of “guys you accidentally draft in round 12 and forget to drop.”  

And your midfield? Chiesa doing cosplay as a missing person, Bernardo fading like a Snapchat streak, Kudus playing like he still thinks he’s in the Eredivisie, and Bamford? My guy, Bamford hasn’t been relevant since Leeds was on Amazon Prime. Your “engine room” has less horsepower than a lawnmower with no gas.  

Let’s not forget the Venmo situation either. You’re walking around like the big dog, but you owe **$4**. Imagine being undefeated and still in debt. You’re basically the Manchester United of this league: lots of history, lots of noise, and financially upside down.  

Here’s the truth, Josiah: you’re **3–0**, but it’s all smoke. You’re sitting on a house of cards built on narrow wins and João Pedro penalties. The moment variance stops kissing you on the cheek, you’re going to collapse so hard the league will rename you *the 404 Error-one.*  

Enjoy the top while it lasts — because when you finally lose, it won’t be pretty, it’ll be biblical. And you’re going to look less like “Football Thanos” and more like bargain-bin Loki getting rag-dolled by the Hulk. 🪦  

---

## 💀 Peter “Peattle Pounders” Henze – 39 pts
Peter, you put up **39 points** this week and still caught an L to Chris. And let’s be honest: losing to Chris is bad enough, but losing while funding his monthly crown is downright tragic. You basically showed up to your own robbery, handed him the cash, and said, “Here, take my dignity too.”  

Your squad is the definition of false hope. You’ve got Bowen and Evanilson trying their best to keep the lights on, but the rest of your team looks like it was drafted off a LinkedIn job board. Richards, Van Hecke, Malen, Anderson… these aren’t fantasy footballers, these are names you see on a guest list for a corporate retreat. And three Estêvãos? What is this, a breeding farm? Nobody needs triplets in their midfield, Peter.  

Even your goalkeepers look confused. Vicario? Perri? This isn’t FPL, this is the MLS discovery draft. It’s like you raided the back of a Panini sticker book and said, “Yeah, this will do.”  

And let’s not forget your name. *Peattle Pounders* sounds intimidating, but your squad couldn’t pound a garlic clove. Week after week, you’re proving that the only thing getting pounded is… you.  

The cold reality: you’re sitting at **0–3** with no wins, no money, and a roster that screams “charity case.” At this point, your entire existence in this league is just to boost other people’s morale. You’re the Washington Generals, Peter. The punching bag. The tutorial level.  

So here’s your epitaph: while everyone else is chasing glory, you’re chasing mediocrity. And the saddest part? Mediocrity is running faster than you. 🪦  

---

## 💀 Roy “This Year FC” Boateng – 39 pts
Roy, your team name is *This Year FC* — but let’s be honest, it’s **never** your year. You’ve been floating around the top half like some kind of dark horse, but everyone knows you’re just waiting to trip on your own shoelaces. You squeaked past Noah **39–38** this week, which isn’t a win, it’s a clerical error. That’s the fantasy equivalent of passing your driving test because the instructor fell asleep.  

You keep branding yourself like a title threat, but nothing about your squad screams “champion.” Mbeumo and Enzo occasionally show up like unpaid interns, but the rest of your roster looks like Arsenal’s reserves and Chelsea’s regrets. Rúben, Schär, Calafiori? That’s not a backline, that’s a museum exhibit labeled “Guys Who Tried Their Best.”  

And don’t think we forgot your bank tab. You’re sitting on **$0 in winnings** while owing **$5** — the full “participation debt package.” That’s like going to a casino, losing everything at blackjack, and still getting hit with the parking fee. Chris is out here cashing checks, Josiah’s undefeated, and you? You’re just funneling money like an FPL Robin Hood who forgot the part about robbing the rich.  

The worst part? You’re undefeated… but nobody’s scared of you. You’re the guy who goes 10 rounds in a fight without throwing a single punch. Technically still standing, but everyone’s wondering why you even showed up.  

Here’s the truth: when September hits, you’re going to fold faster than a lawn chair. And when people look back on *This Year FC*, they won’t think “title run,” they’ll think “false advertising.” 🪦  

---

## 💀 Noah “Trophies Matter FC” Wilson – 38 pts
Noah, your team name is *Trophies Matter FC*… which is hilarious, because you’re not sniffing a trophy this year. Your entire season so far has been one long participation ribbon. You just lost **38–39** to Roy, which means you got beat by a guy whose highlight reel is “accidental victories.” That’s like losing a dance-off to someone who sprained their ankle in warm-ups.  

Your squad? It’s a graveyard of “almosts.” Watkins and Richarlison leading the line? That’s not a strike force, that’s a support group. Richarlison’s career is basically a TikTok compilation of missed sitters, and Watkins looks like he’s still trying to find his shooting boots from 2022. Meanwhile, Nmecha is in your squad twice, because one version wasn’t disappointing enough.  

And your midfield — oh boy. Marmoush? Neto? Cullen? This isn’t fantasy football, this is the random name generator from Football Manager. Mac Allister? The man’s allergic to fantasy points. Savinho and Robertson? Bro, those are vibes, not weapons. You’ve built a midfield that would lose to an under-12 futsal team.  

Let’s also not forget the context: you’re sitting on **3 points** in the league table, owing **$5**, and the only reason anyone remembers you exist is because your name keeps popping up in other people’s match recaps. You’re basically the NPC of this league — always there, never relevant.  

Here’s the painful truth, Noah: trophies may matter, but the only thing your team is lifting this season is everyone else’s spirits. 🪦  

---

## 💀 Andrew “Cunha Get Me Points” Smith – 37 pts
Andrew, your team name is *Cunha Get Me Points* — and the answer is **no.** No, you cannot. Week after week you’re proving that your squad is less about scoring points and more about starring in a cautionary tale. You just lost **37–40** to Josiah in what has to be the saddest match of the season so far. That wasn’t football, that was two toddlers slapping each other with pool noodles until one gave up.  

Your squad construction looks like you drafted while blindfolded. Haaland is your entire personality — without him, your team has the firepower of a wet tissue. Strand Larsen, Barry, Bobb, Acheampong… who even are these guys? Your roster reads like the NPC list from a FIFA career mode save gone wrong. And then you went and traded Martinelli for Palhinha. Bold move, bro — swapping an actual footballer for a defensive mid whose fantasy ceiling is “maybe three points if he doesn’t foul anyone.”  

And let’s not forget your debt. You owe **$5**, which means not only are you losing on the pitch, you’re also losing financially. You’re basically running an FPL charity at this point — funneling money to Chris, Josiah, and Kyle like they’re UNICEF.  

*Cunha Get Me Points?* More like *Cunha Get Me Help.* You’re 2–1, but nobody’s fooled. Your wins are fraudulent, your roster is a comedy show, and the second Haaland blanks, your season goes up in flames.  

Here’s the reality: you’re not a dark horse, you’re glue factory material. And when the collapse comes — and it *will* come — the only thing you’ll be remembered for is being Josiah’s warm-up act. 🪦  

---

## 💀 Kyle “Extended Foreplay” Herrera – 30 pts
Kyle, your team name is *Extended Foreplay* — but let’s be real, there’s nothing extended about it. Your squad fizzles out faster than a middle school dance. Forget foreplay, this is premature elimination. You put up **30 points** this week and limped to a win over Sean, which is like bragging you beat a toddler in an arm-wrestling match. Nobody’s impressed, and everyone feels a little uncomfortable watching it happen.  

Your squad is a comedy special. Salah is your one real player, and even he looks bored out of his mind carrying this circus. After that, it’s a lineup of Delap, Muniz, Isidor, Hudson-Odoi… this isn’t an FPL roster, this is a witness protection list. And the duplicates? Two Isidors, two Barnes? What’s the plan here, Kyle — draft players like Pokémon cards and hope one evolves?  

And don’t get me started on your debt. You owe **$4**, which is just enough to sting but not enough to justify how bad you’ve been. You’re the guy walking around the league acting like you’ve “got momentum” while everyone else is just laughing behind your back because they know your squad is one Salah blank away from total implosion.  

*Extended Foreplay?* Please. This isn’t foreplay, it’s 15 seconds of confusion followed by an awkward apology. You’re not teasing the league, you’re embarrassing yourself in slow motion.  

The truth is brutal, Kyle: you’re not a contender, you’re comic relief. And when people look back at this season, they won’t say, “Wow, remember Kyle’s run?” They’ll say, “Wow, remember when Kyle thought he had a run?” 🪦  

---

## 💀 Harry “cunha believe it” Liu – 29 pts
Harry, you scraped **29 points** this week and somehow managed to beat Zryan **29–28.** That’s not a win, that’s a clerical error. That’s two drunk raccoons fighting over garbage and one stumbling away “victorious.” You didn’t outplay anyone — you just survived by being *slightly* less pathetic. Congrats, your team is the human embodiment of a participation trophy.  

Your roster is the definition of chaos with no payoff. Mitoma and Palmer are supposed to be your stars, but they’re surrounded by the Island of Misfit Toys: Tavernier, Ndoye, Beto, Šeško… these aren’t players, these are names you’d generate by accident on Football Manager.

Your defense is a car crash too. Kerkez, Aina, Livramento, Yoro, Digne… you’ve basically assembled the Avengers of “solid but irrelevant.” They’ll get you the occasional six-pointer, sure, but nobody’s scared of your backline. This is fantasy football, not a home renovation project — stop hoarding defenders like you’re planning for an apocalypse.  

And let’s not ignore the Venmo tab: **$5 owed.** You’re walking around like the self-appointed commissioner, building league recaps and writing roasts, while simultaneously bankrolling Chris’s grocery runs. Imagine talking the most in the group chat while paying rent to your rivals. Peak humiliation.  

Here’s the ugly truth: your team name is *cunha believe it,* but every week we all look at your lineup and say, “Yeah, we can believe it — it’s garbage.” You’re not climbing the table, Harry. You’re squatting in mid-table mediocrity with no escape plan.  

And when the season ends, the only thing people will remember about you is this: you talked the loudest, you roasted the hardest… and you still got cooked by your own squad.

⸻  

## 💀 Zryan “FootAndBallFetish” Bhao – 28 pts

Zryan, you put up **28 points** this week and lost to Harry. Let me repeat that: you lost to Harry. That’s not just a defeat, that’s a war crime. When your squad is worse than a team that starts Ndoye, you don’t just need transfers — you need divine intervention.

Your team name is FootAndBallFetish, and yeah, it shows — because you clearly drafted with your eyes closed and your brain turned off. You’ve got Cunha, Gordon, Piroe, Iwobi, Ekitiké… bro, this isn’t fantasy football, this is a Premier League rehab clinic. Your forward line is a sad Tinder date: looks promising on paper, delivers nothing, and leaves everyone regretting their time.

And let’s not gloss over the midfield. Gordon didn’t play, Piroe didn’t play, Jackson didn’t play. Half your midfield is basically the Bermuda Triangle — players enter, but no points ever come back. Ndiaye is your “bright spot,” which is the fantasy equivalent of bragging that you found a nickel in the couch cushions.

Defensively? Kilman and Rodon are your standouts. Kilman. And. Rodon. That’s not a defense, that’s the Welsh/West Ham branch of the Dollar Store.

You’re sitting at 0–3, dead last, with $5 owed. You haven’t sniffed a win, you haven’t sniffed a payout, and at this point, you’re just here to make everyone else feel better about their squads. You’re not FootAndBallFetish — you’re the league’s punching bag, the morale booster, the NPC that makes the actual storyline move along.

Here’s the reality, Zryan: your season is already over. You’re not chasing wins, you’re chasing dignity. And spoiler alert: you won’t catch it. 🪦

⸻  

## 💀 Sean “Gweepy” Dunn – 20 pts

Sean, you didn’t just have a bad week — you had a public execution. **20 points**. Lowest in the league. That’s not a fantasy team, that’s a cry for help. Your squad is less “Premier League draft” and more “what if I built my roster entirely from spare IKEA screws and prayer candles.”

You lost to Kyle — Kyle! The guy who runs “Extended Foreplay” and still hasn’t figured out how to draft players who actually exist. That’s like getting dunked on by your little cousin on a Fisher-Price hoop. We all laughed, but deep down we felt bad, because at this point beating you doesn’t even feel like an achievement — it feels like bullying.

Your squad is tragic. Raya and Pickford in goal? Congratulations, you’ve assembled the Avengers of getting scored on. Your midfield is a crime scene: Saka, Foden, Gvardiol, Rodrigo, Bruno G… sounds like stars, plays like extras. And don’t think we missed it — you’ve got  O’Riley. What’s the plan there, Sean? Drafting names like you’re starting a boyband? Spoiler: they can’t sing and they sure as hell can’t score.

And that forward line? Igor Jesus and Wilson. That’s not an attack, that’s a warning sign. If your strikers walked into a nightclub, the bouncers wouldn’t even let them in — too weak, too irrelevant.

You’re sitting on 3 points, bottom of the monthly standings, and owe $5 just for existing. The truth is simple: you’re the league’s floor. Everyone else is standing on your corpse to climb the table.

Here’s your legacy, Sean: not “Gweepy,” but “Creepy.” Because the only thing scary about your team is how bad it is. When people look back at this season, you won’t be remembered for upsets or comebacks — you’ll be remembered as the guy who turned FPL into an active act of self-harm. 🪦

⸻  

📅 **Next Week Fixtures – Blood Incoming**  
⚔️ Harry “cunha believe it” vs Josiah “thenotsospecialone”

Harry barely scraped a 29–28 win last week, while Josiah is strutting around 3–0 like he invented fantasy football. This is David vs. Goliath if David left his slingshot at home and just hoped Goliath tripped. Josiah’s due for exposure, Harry’s due for humiliation — either way, expect Venmo requests flying before kickoff.

Prediction: Josiah wins, Harry writes a 2,000-word roast essay to cope.

⸻

⚔️ Andrew “Cunha Get Me Points” vs Sean “Gweepy”

The “Sad Boy Derby.” Andrew just lost to Josiah in the league’s saddest slap-fight, and Sean is averaging the kind of scores that make people question if he’s trolling on purpose. This isn’t a football match, it’s two dudes fighting over who gets to sleep on the couch.

Prediction: Andrew squeaks by, Sean becomes the first manager in history to be mathematically eliminated in September.

⸻

⚔️ Kyle “Extended Foreplay” vs Don “son4lyfe”

Extended Foreplay vs Son4lyfe: this sounds like a bad fanfic, and it’ll play out like one too. Kyle’s team is all buildup with no finish, while Don’s squad is basically Bruno + Szoboszlai dragging corpses across the finish line. Someone’s walking away with a fraudulent win here, but hey — at least one of them will finally feel relevant.

Prediction: Don wins ugly, Kyle renames his squad “One Minute Wonder.”

⸻

⚔️ Ronangel “Atlético SeaSlug” vs Noah “Trophies Matter FC”

Ron just lost to Don. Noah just lost to Roy. These two are battling not for glory, but for the right to not be the league’s most forgettable manager. SeaSlug vs. Trophies Matter? More like Snail vs. Participation Ribbon.

Prediction: Noah edges it, Ron slithers back to irrelevance.

⸻

⚔️ Roy “This Year FC” vs Chris “Schrödongers”

Unbeaten vs. the money-printing cat. On paper, this is a “clash of titans,” but let’s be honest — Roy’s undefeated streak has been softer than warm butter, and Chris’s luck is due to run out. Still, Chris is basically farming the league for Venmo cash at this point, so until proven otherwise, he’s the IRS.

Prediction: Chris wins, Roy gets exposed, and “This Year FC” officially becomes “Next Year FC.”

⸻

⚔️ Peter “Peattle Pounders” vs Zryan “FootAndBallFetish”

The Toilet Bowl. Both managers are 0–3. Both squads look like they were drafted by interns. This isn’t about winning, this is about survival. The loser here doesn’t just go 0–4 — they basically forfeit their dignity for the season.

Prediction: Peter squeaks it out, Zryan spirals into full NPC status. 

⸻  

🎤 **Final Verdict**  
This week was pure chaos: Chris lucked into another W and stole the August crown, Josiah is still undefeated but already looking fraudulent, Don finally got a win and celebrated like he’d lifted the Champions League, and Sean reminded us all why he’s basically the league’s charity case. Half of you owe money, all of you owe dignity, and somehow Chris is walking around like the IRS with everyone’s Venmo balances in his pocket.

But let’s not sugarcoat it:
	•	Chris is living on borrowed time — his squad is duct tape and miracles.
	•	Josiah’s 3–0 is faker than VAR lines.
	•	Don and Ron fighting each other is like two slugs racing across wet pavement.
	•	Kyle and Harry are pretending to be relevant while bleeding $4–5 each.
	•	Noah, Peter, and Zryan are NPCs at this point — background characters in Chris’s money-grabbing main quest.
	•	And Sean? Sean’s team is so bad the league should start issuing welfare points just to keep him from crying.

GW3 told us one thing loud and clear: this league isn’t about football. It’s about humiliation, Venmo debt, and surviving long enough to roast someone else.
