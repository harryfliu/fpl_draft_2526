# 💀 GW6 FPL Draft League: False Prophets, Lucky Survivors, & Andrew’s Double-Dip 💀  

Week 6 wasn’t football — it was a **mass extinction event**. Nobody looked like a manager. Half the league couldn’t score more than a substitute goalkeeper, Kyle posted a number so low scientists will classify it as a cryptid, and Josiah somehow stayed undefeated by winning a slap fight against a cadaver.  

By the end of it:  
- Andrew didn’t just win, he **ransacked the treasury** like a sewer rat king.  
- Ron slimed into second place, proving snails can move if you bribe them with pity points.  
- Peter stacked back-to-back competent weeks, which is like watching a goldfish learn algebra.  
- And the rest? A Renaissance painting of fraudulence, cowardice, and historic levels of shame.  

Line them up. It’s execution time.

## 🍻 Andrew “Cunha Get Me Points” Smith – 65 pts  
*Weekly Winner + Monthly Winner*  

Andrew didn’t just win. He looted the weekly prize, pocketed the monthly, and left the rest of you in a financial crater. 65 points in this famine of a week is like walking into a soup kitchen and eating everyone’s meal in front of them.  

Harry, your opponent, scored 35. That wasn’t a match. That was Andrew filming a live-action snuff film. It wasn’t “Cunha Get Me Points.” It was “Cunha Get Me Amnesty from the Geneva Convention.”  

Andrew, you’re 4–2 now, smug as a raccoon rolling in stolen garbage. Everyone hates you, and that’s the only honest victory you’ve ever earned.

## 💀 Ronangel “Atlético SeaSlug” Rojas – 45 pts  

Ron, congratulations: 45 points. You beat Sean. That’s like beating a toddler in an arm-wrestling contest — technically true, deeply unimpressive.  

You’re still the human embodiment of damp moss. A slug with a jersey. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids. Every time you manage to scrape a win, the entire league side-eyes the calendar like, “Who got cursed this week?”  

Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You’re 3–3 and still irrelevant.  

---

## 💀 Peter “Peattle Pounders” Henze – 43 pts  

Peter, 43 points, 43–29 over Noah. For the first time in your pathetic little career, you’ve strung together two weeks of competence. That’s not a run — that’s a clerical error.  

But let’s not lie: you beat **Noah**. That’s like bragging you dunked on a middle schooler. You’re not a Pounder. You’re a Peashooter.  

Still, back-to-back relevance is historic for you. Which says less about your team and more about the geological pace at which your dignity usually arrives.  

---

## 💀 Harry “cunha believe it” Liu – 35 pts  

Harry, you lost 35–65 to Andrew. That wasn’t a match, that was an **execution livestream**.  

Your record is 2–4 with a GD of –61, which is so catastrophic it looks like you’re running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance*.  

“cunha believe it”? Yeah, we can’t. We can’t believe you still submit lineups. You’re the league’s comedy open mic: occasionally a chuckle, mostly silence and pity.  

---

## 💀 chris “Schrödongers” duncam – 35 pts  

Chris, 35 points and you beat Zryan 35–33. That’s not a win. That’s two sewer rats fighting over a discarded Pop-Tart.  

You’re 4–2 and somehow in fourth, but nobody’s fooled. You’re Schrödinger’s Manager: both alive and dead, but always irrelevant. This week you were technically alive — in the way a rotting fish is technically organic matter.  

Enjoy your fraudulent 4–2. You’re a Jenga tower of luck, one shaky pull away from collapse.  

---

## 💀 Zryan “FootAndBallFetish” Bhao – 33 pts  

Zryan, 33 points. Another loss. 1–5, –45 GD. You are the league’s public utility: everyone plugs into you for free wins.  

“FootAndBallFetish”? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation**. Every week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine.  

Your one purpose this week was making Chris look like a winner. That’s not management. That’s masochism with spreadsheets.  

---

## 💀 Roy “This Year FC” Boateng – 32 pts  

Roy, 32 points. You’re 5–1. Fraud alert.  

You beat Don, who scored 25. That’s like winning a boxing match because the other guy showed up drunk and barefoot.  

You’re Arsenal cosplay without the flair. Your wins are softer than cafeteria mashed potatoes, and every week you scream “THIS YEAR IS MINE” like a guy who buys scratchers at 7-Eleven. Spoiler: it’s never your year.  

---

## 💀 Sean “Gweepy” Dunn – 30 pts  

Sean, 30 points. That’s not a fantasy score, that’s a thermostat setting. You lost to Ron like the NPC you are.  

You’re 3–3, a perfect record of nothingness. You’re not hot, not cold, just lukewarm failure. Gweepy isn’t a team name, it’s the noise a cartoon pigeon makes when it flies into a window. And that’s you — every single week.  

---

## 💀 Noah “Trophies Matter FC” Wilson – 29 pts  

Noah, 29 points, another L. You lost to **Peter**. That’s so embarrassing it should come with a wellness check.  

You’re 1–5 with a GD of –45. Your team isn’t a squad. It’s a garage sale of broken appliances. “Trophies Matter”? Not in this timeline. The only trophy you’re sniffing is *Most Forgettable Human Being in the League*.  

---

## 💀 Josiah “thenotsospecialone” Loh – 28 pts  

Josiah, 6–0. Fraud king.  

You scored 28 points. That’s not a win — that’s variance handing you a W because Kyle’s team disintegrated like a sandcastle in the rain.  

Your record looks godlike, but everyone knows you’re an empty husk floating on luck’s tide. You’re not the special one. You’re the **bubble boy of fantasy football** — undefeated because the universe wrapped you in protection. And one day soon, the bubble’s going to pop.  

---

## 💀 Don “son4lyfe” Kim – 25 pts  

Don, 25 points. You lost to Roy, who himself only managed 32. That’s like showing up to a clown contest and still being the least funny guy there.  

Your roster looks like a pawn shop fire sale. Your transfer activity reads like drunk texting. And Son — the player you literally named your team after — would probably sue you for defamation if he saw this disaster.  

You’re not son4lyfe. You’re **loss4lyfe**.  

---

## 💀 Kyle “Extended Foreplay” Herrera – 17 pts  

Kyle. Seventeen points. That’s not a score. That’s a **war crime**.  

You lost 17–28 to Josiah, gifting him another fraudulent win. Your team name is Extended Foreplay — which is perfect, because all you do is tease and never, ever finish.  

Seventeen points should be studied by historians. Archaeologists will dig this up centuries from now and classify it as evidence of human regression. Your squad is the Mariana Trench of fantasy football: unimaginably deep, dark, and crushing.  

You’re not a manager. You’re a **tragic legend in failure**.

# 🎤 Final Verdict: The GW6 Hall of Shame  

GW6 wasn’t a competition. It was a funeral with clown music.  

🥇 **Andrew** — Sewer Rat King. Robbed the prize pool, robbed Harry’s dignity, robbed us of peace.  
🥈 **Ron** — Slimed into relevance, still a salt shaker away from irrelevance.  
🥉 **Peter** — Two weeks of competence. Miraculous, but don’t get comfortable.  

And the rest? A parade of shame:  

4. **Harry** — Bodybagged by Andrew. –61 GD. Should be exiled.  
5. **Chris** — Beat Zryan in a dumpster fight. Still mid.  
6. **Zryan** — Fetish for losing. You’re not a manager; you’re a community service project.  
7. **Roy** — 5–1 fraud. Built on hot air and cupcake fixtures.  
8. **Sean** — Cartoon pigeon. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk.  
9. **Noah** — Lost to Peter. Delete your account.  
10. **Josiah** — 6–0 bubble boy. Top of the league, bottom of respect.  
11. **Don** — Pawn shop of despair. Walking L.  
12. **Kyle** — 17 points. Mariana Trench. The GOAT of failure.  

GW6’s legacy? Nobody here is chasing greatness. You’re all sprinting away from humiliation, and somehow you’re still getting caught.
