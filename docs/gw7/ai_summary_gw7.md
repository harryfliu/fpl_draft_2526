# üî• GW7 FPL Draft League: The International Break Massacre & Fraud Exposed üî•

Week 7 wasn't just bad ‚Äî it was a **catastrophic failure of human intelligence** that should be studied by psychologists as evidence that some people are genetically predisposed to being terrible at everything. Josiah continued his fraudulent reign of terror like a virus that won't die, while the rest of you put on a **masterclass in how to fail so spectacularly** that it becomes performance art.

This was so bad that even the **referees** felt sorry for you. The scores were so pathetic that if this were a job interview, you'd all be **homeless by now**.

By the end of this **international break warm-up disaster**:  
- Josiah **robbed the treasury again** with 59 points, proving that even broken clocks are right twice a day.  
- Ron **slimed his way to second** with 52 points, which is like winning a **participation trophy at your own funeral**.  
- Sean **annihilated Zryan** 49-27, which is like watching a **professional wrestler fight a toddler** and calling it a match.  
- And the rest? A **Renaissance painting of failure** so beautiful it belongs in a museum of human inadequacy.

**Line them up. It's execution time.**

## üíÄ Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera ‚Äì 45 pts  

Kyle, 45 points and you lost to Ron. Your team is like a **caterpillar that's been in its cocoon for three years** - you keep promising to transform into a butterfly but you're just getting more and more confused about what a butterfly even is. Your "Extended Foreplay" name is so accurate it's like you're conducting a **symphony of disappointment** where every note is just slightly off-key, creating a haunting melody that makes people question the meaning of existence.

You're the kind of manager who would **order a pizza and then spend 45 minutes deciding which slice to eat first**, only to realize the pizza has gone cold and you've lost your appetite. Your 45 points is like finding a **dollar bill in a washing machine** - technically good, but it's wet, wrinkled, and you're not sure if it's still legal tender.

**Your performance was like watching someone try to parallel park a shopping cart in a parking space designed for a bicycle.**

---

## üíÄ Harry "cunha believe it" Liu ‚Äì 39 pts  

Harry, 39 points and you **got the win** against Noah 39-32. Your team is like a **broken vending machine that occasionally dispenses exactly what you want**, but only after you've kicked it 47 times and threatened to call the manager. Your "cunha believe it" name is so accurate it's like you're living in a **parallel universe where disbelief is the default state of being**.

You're the kind of manager who would **win a game of rock-paper-scissors by accidentally throwing a live lobster**, confusing everyone including yourself. Your goal difference of -54 is like having a **credit score that's actually a negative number**, which shouldn't be possible but you've somehow achieved it through sheer determination to be terrible.

**Your performance was like watching someone successfully navigate a maze while blindfolded, but only because they got lost and accidentally found the exit.**

---

## üíÄ Roy "This Year FC" Boateng ‚Äì 39 pts  

Roy, 39 points and you beat Andrew 39-33. Your team is like a **fortune teller who's always right about the past but completely wrong about the future** - you keep saying "THIS YEAR IS MINE" like you're trying to manifest it into existence through sheer repetition. Your 6-1 record is like having a **perfect attendance record at a school that doesn't actually exist**.

You're the kind of manager who would **order a medium coffee and somehow end up with a large latte and a confused barista**, but you'd still claim it was exactly what you wanted. Your confidence is like a **weather balloon filled with helium and wishful thinking** - it's impressive how high it goes, but everyone knows it's going to pop eventually.

**Your performance was like watching someone successfully parallel park a semi-truck in a space designed for a bicycle, but only because they accidentally drove through the building first.**

---

## üíÄ Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith ‚Äì 33 pts  

Andrew, 33 points and you lost to Roy. Your team is like a **magician who's forgotten all their tricks but still insists on performing**, so you just stand there waving your hands around while the audience slowly realizes you're not actually doing anything. Your "Cunha Get Me Points" name is so ironic it's like you're living in a **universe where irony has become a physical force** that's actively working against you.

You're the kind of manager who would **order a pizza and then spend the entire delivery time trying to remember what pizza even is**, only to realize you've been staring at a menu for 45 minutes. Your 4-3 record is like having a **perfect score on a test that was actually about a completely different subject** - technically impressive, but completely irrelevant to what you're supposed to be doing.

**Your performance was like watching someone try to solve a Rubik's cube by throwing it at a wall repeatedly, and somehow getting closer to solving it each time.**

---

## üíÄ Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson ‚Äì 32 pts  

Noah, 32 points and you lost to **HARRY**. Your team is like a **trophy case that's been empty for so long it's started collecting dust bunnies and existential dread**. Your "Trophies Matter" name is so ironic it's like you're living in a **universe where trophies are actually allergic to you** and run away whenever you get close to them.

You're the kind of manager who would **order a trophy online and somehow receive a participation certificate for a spelling bee you never entered**, but you'd still frame it and put it on your wall. Your 1-6 record is like having a **perfect score on a test about how to fail at everything**, which is technically impressive but completely missing the point.

**Your performance was like watching someone try to win a race by running in the opposite direction, but somehow still managing to cross the finish line first because everyone else got confused and started following you.**

---

## üíÄ Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze ‚Äì 32 pts  

Peter, 32 points and you got **OBLITERATED by Josiah** 59-32. Your team is like a **peashooter that's been loaded with actual peas instead of ammunition**, so you just keep firing vegetables at your opponents while they look at you with a mixture of confusion and pity. Your "Peattle Pounders" name is so accurate it's like you're living in a **universe where all weapons have been replaced with kitchen utensils**.

You're the kind of manager who would **order a steak and somehow receive a single pea on a plate**, but you'd still try to eat it with a fork and knife while maintaining perfect table manners. Your 2-5 record is like having a **perfect score on a test about how to be completely average**, which is technically an achievement but not the kind anyone wants to brag about.

**Your performance was like watching someone try to break down a door by gently knocking on it with a feather, but somehow still managing to make the door open because the person inside got curious about what was making that weird tapping sound.**

## üíÄ Zryan ‚ÄúFootAndBallFetish‚Äù Bhao ‚Äì 27 pts  
*Roasted by Sean ‚ÄúGweepy‚Äù Dunn*  

**Sean:** ‚ÄúZryan, buddy‚Ä¶ 27 points? My condolences.‚Äù  

You lost 49‚Äì27. That‚Äôs like losing a **thumb war to someone with no thumbs** ‚Äî technically possible, emotionally career-ending.  

You‚Äôre still the human embodiment of **wasted potential** ‚Äî a man-shaped reminder that raw hope can, in fact, rot. Your roster looks like it was drafted by an **AI trained exclusively on failure**.  

Whenever you break 20, the whole league goes, *‚ÄúWho pissed off the fantasy gods this week?‚Äù*  

And your team name ‚Äî *FootAndBallFetish* ‚Äî man, that‚Äôs irony so thick it should be sold by the pound. Twenty-seven points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock**.  

**Enjoy your irrelevance, Zryan. You‚Äôre 1-6 and aging like unrefrigerated milk.**

---

## üíÄ Chris ‚ÄúSchr√∂dongers‚Äù Duncam ‚Äì 25 pts  
*Roasted by Don ‚Äúson4lyfe‚Äù Kim*  

**Don:** ‚ÄúChris, congrats on your 25-point masterpiece. Truly, art in its ugliest form.‚Äù  

You won 25‚Äì24. That‚Äôs not a win ‚Äî that‚Äôs a **coin flip that landed on its side**.  

You‚Äôre still the walking TED Talk on **false confidence**. You speak in theories, but your team performs like it‚Äôs running PowerPoint slides instead of plays. Every W you get feels like a **statistical hiccup in the matrix**.  

And that name ‚Äî *Schr√∂dongers*? You‚Äôre not quantum, bro. You‚Äôre just **both mid and overhyped at the same time**.  

Twenty-five points is what I get when I **auto-draft and go on vacation**.  

**Congrats on 5-2, Chris. You‚Äôre basically a house of cards with delusions of architecture.**

---

## üíÄ Don ‚Äúson4lyfe‚Äù Kim ‚Äì 24 pts  
*Roasted by Chris ‚ÄúSchr√∂dongers‚Äù Duncam*  

**Chris:** ‚ÄúDon, I‚Äôd say ‚Äòtough loss,‚Äô but at 24 points, that would imply effort.‚Äù  

You lost 25‚Äì24. That‚Äôs not football ‚Äî that‚Äôs a **slow-motion car crash with your dignity in the passenger seat**.  

You‚Äôre still the human highlight reel of **wasted talent**. Your lineup choices read like **a man trying to outsmart himself and losing every round**. Every time you scrape past 20, the group chat collectively sighs, *‚ÄúNot this clown again.‚Äù*  

And *son4lyfe*? Nothing screams misplaced loyalty like naming yourself after the thing you keep letting down.  

Twenty-four points? That‚Äôs what I get when I **start my bench on purpose**.  

**Enjoy the walk of shame, Don. You‚Äôre 2-5, forgettable, and one bad week away from becoming a trivia question.**

# üé§ Final Verdict: The GW7 Hall of Shame

GW7 wasn't a competition. It was a **funeral procession** with clown music and a side of **complete human failure**.

ü•á **Josiah** ‚Äî Fraud King. Stole another prize, still undefeated through pure luck and the universe's sick sense of humor.  
ü•à **Ron** ‚Äî Slimed into second, still a slug with a jersey and the personality of wet cardboard.  
ü•â **Sean** ‚Äî Crushed Zryan in a dumpster fire of a match that made people question the meaning of life.

And the rest? A parade of **mediocrity and failure** so spectacular it belongs in a museum:

4. **Kyle** ‚Äî Lost to Ron. Extended Foreplay indeed, like a broken vibrator.  
5. **Harry** ‚Äî Beat Noah in a battle of who's less terrible. Still a walking disaster.  
6. **Roy** ‚Äî 6-1 fraud. Built on hot air and other people's failures.  
7. **Andrew** ‚Äî Welcome to mediocrity. Your prize days are over.  
8. **Noah** ‚Äî Lost to Harry. Delete your account and your dignity.  
9. **Peter** ‚Äî Demolished by Josiah. Still terrible.  
10. **Zryan** ‚Äî Crushed by Sean. Community service project for other people's wins.  
11. **Chris** ‚Äî Beat Don in a seizure competition. Still a fraud.  
12. **Don** ‚Äî Lost to Chris. Pawn shop of despair and broken dreams.

GW7's legacy? **Nobody here is chasing greatness**. You're all sprinting away from humiliation, and somehow you're still getting caught.

The only thing more embarrassing than these scores is the fact that **Josiah is still undefeated**.

## üèÜ The Fraud King's Reign of Terror
- **Josiah**: 7-0, 322 total points, +103 goal difference
- **Reality Check**: This is statistically impossible without divine intervention or pure luck
- **Fun Fact**: If Josiah were a country, he'd be North Korea ‚Äî completely isolated from reality

- **Peter**: 2-5, -28 goal difference, 262 total points (32 pts this week)
- **Reality Check**: These five combined for 11 wins in 35 games. That's a 31.4% win rate.
- **Fun Fact**: If these five were a business, they'd be bankrupt faster than a cryptocurrency startup

## üé≠ The Fraudulent Middle Pack
- **Roy**: 6-1 but built on the backs of other people's failures
- **Reality Check**: These records are like a house of cards built on quicksand
- **Fun Fact**: If Roy were a politician, he'd be the most corrupt one in history

## üìà The Statistical Anomalies
- **Average Points Per Game**: 35.2 (pathetic)
- **Highest Single Game Score**: 65 (Andrew in GW6, which was a fluke)
- **Lowest Single Game Score**: 17 (Kyle in GW6, which was not a fluke)
- **Most Consecutive Losses**: 6 (Zryan and Noah, tied for being terrible)

## üî• The International Break Predictions
- **Josiah will lose**: 0% chance (the universe is broken)
- **Someone will actually try**: 15% chance (optimistic)

## üéØ The Bottom Line

The international break is a **blessing** because it gives everyone time to reflect on their life choices and consider whether they should continue existing.

**See you in two weeks when the pain continues.**
