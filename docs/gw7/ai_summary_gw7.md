# 🎭 GW7 FPL Draft League: The Josiah Show, Fraudulent Victories, & The Great Collapse 🎭

Week 7 was a **masterclass in mediocrity** with a side of pure luck. Josiah continued his fraudulent undefeated streak like a cockroach that won't die, while the rest of you put on a clinic in how to fail upward. The scores were so pathetic that even the league's resident frauds looked competent by comparison.

By the end of this disaster:  
- Josiah **stole another weekly prize** with 59 points, proving that even blind squirrels find nuts.  
- Ron somehow **slimed into second** with 52 points, which is like winning a participation trophy at a funeral.  
- Sean **crushed Zryan** 49-27, which is like beating a dead horse and calling it a victory.  
- And the rest? A **Renaissance painting of failure** where everyone lost except the people who shouldn't have won.

Line them up. It's roast time.

## 🏆 Josiah "The Fraud King" Loh – 59 pts  
*Weekly Winner + Still Undefeated*

Josiah, you absolute **con artist**. 59 points and you're still 7-0. This isn't skill — this is the universe having a stroke and accidentally blessing the wrong person.

You beat Peter 59-32, which is like watching a professional boxer fight a toddler and then bragging about it. Your team name is "thenotsospecialone" but you're the **most fraudulent special one** in fantasy football history.

Everyone knows you're riding pure luck. Your wins are built on the backs of other people's failures, and one day soon, reality is going to catch up with you like a debt collector with a baseball bat.

## 🥈 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas – 52 pts  

Ron, 52 points and you beat Kyle 52-45. That's not a victory — that's **two slugs having a slow-motion race** and you happened to cross the finish line first.

You're still the human embodiment of wet cardboard. Your team moves at the pace of continental drift, and every win you get feels like a clerical error. 52 points in this league is like getting a participation trophy for showing up to your own funeral.

Enjoy your slime trail to second place. You're still irrelevant, just slightly less irrelevant than everyone else.

---

## 🥉 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn – 49 pts  

Sean, 49 points and you **demolished Zryan** 49-27. That's not a match, that's a **public service announcement** about what happens when incompetence meets even worse incompetence.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the sound a cartoon character makes when they get hit by a falling piano. And that's exactly what you are — a walking cartoon character of failure.

You're 4-3 now, which is like being the tallest midget. Technically better than some, but still fundamentally disappointing.

---

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera – 45 pts  

Kyle, 45 points and you lost to Ron. That's like losing a staring contest to a goldfish.

Your team name is Extended Foreplay, which is perfect because all you do is **tease and never finish**. You're the fantasy football equivalent of a broken vending machine — lots of noise, no results.

45 points should be studied by scientists as evidence that some people are genetically predisposed to mediocrity.

---

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu – 39 pts  

Harry, 39 points and you **actually won** against Noah 39-32. That's not a victory, that's **two people falling down stairs** and you happened to land on top.

You're 3-4 with a goal difference of -54, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running a **charity for other people's wins**. "cunha believe it"? Yeah, we can't believe you still have a team.

This win was like finding a dollar in a pile of garbage — technically good, but you're still covered in trash.

---

## 💀 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng – 39 pts  

Roy, 39 points and you beat Andrew 39-33. That's like winning a **competition for who can be the least terrible**.

You're 6-1 and still a fraud. Your wins are softer than a marshmallow in a microwave, and every week you scream "THIS YEAR IS MINE" like a guy who buys lottery tickets with his rent money.

This year isn't yours. This year is **nobody's** because everyone here is terrible.

---

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith – 33 pts  

Andrew, 33 points and you lost to Roy. That's like losing a **competition for who can be the most average**.

You're 4-3 now, which means you've officially entered the **mediocrity zone**. "Cunha Get Me Points"? More like "Cunha Get Me a New Team" because this one is broken.

Your weekly prize days are over. Welcome to the **middle of the pack**, where dreams go to die.

---

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson – 32 pts  

Noah, 32 points and you lost to **Harry**. That's so embarrassing it should come with a **wellness check**.

You're 1-6 with a goal difference of -52. Your team isn't a squad, it's a **garage sale of broken dreams**. "Trophies Matter"? Not in this timeline. The only trophy you're getting is *Most Forgettable Human Being in the League*.

Losing to Harry is like losing to a **ghost** — technically possible, but deeply concerning.

---

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze – 32 pts  

Peter, 32 points and you got **demolished by Josiah** 59-32. That's not a match, that's a **public execution**.

You're 2-5 and still terrible. "Peattle Pounders"? More like **Peashooter** because your team hits about as hard as a gentle breeze.

Losing to Josiah by 27 points is like losing a **spelling bee** to someone who can't read.

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao – 27 pts  

Zryan, 27 points and you got **crushed by Sean** 49-27. That's like losing a **thumb war** to someone with no thumbs.

You're 1-6 with a goal difference of -67, which is so bad it looks like you're **intentionally trying to lose**. "FootAndBallFetish"? The only fetish you have is for **humiliation**.

You're not a manager, you're a **community service project** for other people's wins.

---

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam – 25 pts  

Chris, 25 points and you beat Don 25-24. That's not a win, that's **two people having a seizure** and you happened to stop twitching first.

You're 5-2 and still a fraud. You're Schrödinger's Manager: both alive and dead, but always **irrelevant**. This week you were technically alive — in the way a **zombie** is technically alive.

Enjoy your fraudulent 5-2. You're a **house of cards** built on luck and other people's failures.

---

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim – 24 pts  

Don, 24 points and you lost to Chris. That's like losing a **competition for who can be the most forgettable**.

You're 2-5 and still terrible. "son4lyfe"? More like **loss4lyfe** because that's all you do. Your team looks like a **pawn shop fire sale** where everything is broken and overpriced.

Losing to Chris by 1 point is like losing a **coin flip** and then crying about it.

# 🎤 Final Verdict: The GW7 Hall of Shame

GW7 wasn't a competition. It was a **funeral procession** with clown music.

🥇 **Josiah** — Fraud King. Stole another prize, still undefeated through pure luck.  
🥈 **Ron** — Slimed into second, still a slug with a jersey.  
🥉 **Sean** — Crushed Zryan in a dumpster fire of a match.

And the rest? A parade of **mediocrity and failure**:

4. **Kyle** — Lost to Ron. Extended Foreplay indeed.  
5. **Harry** — Beat Noah in a battle of who's less terrible.  
6. **Roy** — 6-1 fraud. Built on hot air and other people's failures.  
7. **Andrew** — Welcome to mediocrity. Your prize days are over.  
8. **Noah** — Lost to Harry. Delete your account.  
9. **Peter** — Demolished by Josiah. Still terrible.  
10. **Zryan** — Crushed by Sean. Community service project.  
11. **Chris** — Beat Don in a seizure competition. Still a fraud.  
12. **Don** — Lost to Chris. Pawn shop of despair.

GW7's legacy? **Nobody here is chasing greatness**. You're all sprinting away from humiliation, and somehow you're still getting caught.

The only thing more embarrassing than these scores is the fact that **Josiah is still undefeated**.
