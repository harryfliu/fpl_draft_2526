# 💀 GW2 Draft FPL Recap: Shattered Egos, Broken Squads, and Crying in the Shower 💀

**WEEKLY WINNER: KYLE**

---

🥇 **Josiah “thenotsospecialone” Loh – 38 pts (6 pts total, 1st place, $11)**

Josiah, you smug prick. You’re 2–0, $11 richer, and you didn’t even need to play well. 38 points of mediocrity was enough to clown Don, who’s basically a training cone at this point.

João Pedro saved your ass (15) while Semenyo (6) chipped in. The rest of your squad? Pure dogshit. Bernardo (1), Chiesa (1), Mitchell (1), Dalot (1), Gusto (2). That’s not a defense, that’s a fucking Make-A-Wish lineup. You basically won because Don’s team is allergic to scoring points.

But here’s the kicker: you still sit top. You can fart your way through a gameweek and walk out undefeated. You’re like Mourinho-era Chelsea if Chelsea’s midfield was patched together from hospital stretchers. Hate you, but respect the grind.

🥈 **Roy “This Year FC” Boateng – 38 pts (6 pts total, 2nd place)**

Roy, you slimy fraud. Every August you start like this, every November you’re crying in the corner. 38 points was just enough to edge Peter, who’s about as threatening as wet toilet paper.

Calafiori (13) bailed you out, Enzo (10) flexed, and Rice (6) put in a shift. The rest? Fucking embarrassing. Schär (1), Ødegaard (1), Mbeumo (2), Aké (1). And your striker? Zirkzee, literal zero. Your attack is as potent as a neutered chihuahua.

“This Year FC”? Please. Rename to Never This Year FC. We’ve seen this movie: you’ll get hype, you’ll start talking smack, and by Christmas you’ll be bottom-half screaming about “bad luck.” Fraudulent as ever.

---

🥉 **Andrew “Cunha Get Me Points” Smith – 41 pts (6 pts total, 3rd place)**

Andrew, you damn bully. 41–21 vs Noah wasn’t a match, it was an execution. You put that man in a shallow grave and pissed on it. Saliba (6), Van de Ven (6), Pape Matar Sarr (8), Petrovic (6)… everyone chipped in while Haaland took the week off with a weak 2 points.

And that’s the terrifying part: Haaland didn’t even do shit and you still ran up the score. Noah’s squad folded like origami while yours casually strolled to +20 GD on the season.

But don’t get cocky, fraud alert is flashing. Strand Larsen (2)? Bobb (2)? Awoniyi riding your bench? This isn’t depth, it’s filler. The moment Haaland sneezes, your whole team will implode. Enjoy 3rd while you can.

---

**Chris “Schrödongers” Duncam – 37 pts (3 pts total, 4th place)**

Chris, you lost 55–37 to Kyle. Let that sink in. Extended Foreplay ran you over like a dump truck. That’s not a loss, that’s a generational humiliation.

Your squad is Schrödinger’s Cat: alive enough to hit 37, dead enough to be unwatchable. Dango (13) and Chalobah (8) carried you like exhausted parents dragging their dumbass kid through Disneyland. Everyone else? A parade of ones, twos, and zeros. Wood (2) up top is laughable — man’s built for relegation, not draft.

You’re 4th now, but it’s fake. Without Dango popping off like a firework, you’re 10th. Fraud team, fraud manager, fraud vibes.

---

**Ronangel “Atlético SeaSlug” Rojas – 50 pts (3 pts total, 5th place)**

Ronangel, the slug slimed into 50 points this week and actually looked competent. Gyökeres (12), Grealish (11), and Gakpo (10) formed a Big Three that bodybagged Zryan.

But peel the slime off and it’s still gross underneath. Muñoz (5) is fine, but Guehi (2), Lewis (1), Elanga (2), J.Arias (1), Raúl (1)… that’s basically 5 players roleplaying as cardboard cutouts. Your bench is Ramsdale (0), Tosin (2), Mosquera (1), Caicedo (1). Absolutely disgusting.

This was your peak. Enjoy 5th, slime boy. The salt is coming.

---

**Kyle “Extended Foreplay” Herrera – 55 pts (3 pts total, 6th place, $11)**

Kyle, you miracle merchant. Last week everyone laughed at you. This week you dropped 55 on Chris’s head. Timber (24) is the reason you exist. Salah (5) and Hudson-Odoi (10) sprinkled some life. And Cucurella (5) gave you competence.

But your forwards are Delap (2) and Muniz (0). That’s not a frontline, that’s two dudes waiting outside the club hoping to get in. Amad (1), Madueke (3), Barnes (2). Your attack is vibes and prayer.

Extended Foreplay lasted long enough to finish this week, but next week you’re back to two-pump chump. Don’t let this W fool you — your team is still a pile of piss.

---

**Sean “Gweepy” Dunn – 35 pts (3 pts total, 7th place)**

Sean, you beat Harry. Congrats on dunking a toddler. 35–23 isn’t impressive, it’s just proof Harry’s team is a dumpster fire. Tarkowski (8) carried your defense, Saka (6) and Bruno G (6) chipped in. Raya (6) was solid.

But everything else was absolute wank. Igor Jesus (1) and Wilson (1) up top? That’s not a strike force, that’s an Amber Alert. Foden (1), Rodrigo (1), O’Riley (2). Your mids were invisible.

You’re in 7th because Harry exists. Against anyone else, you’re barbecue chicken. Mid-table forever.

---

**Harry “cunha believe it” Liu – 23 pts (3 pts total, 8th place)**

Harry, you absolute damn clown. 23 points. Lost to Sean. Your squad is the fantasy equivalent of stepping on a rake.

Šeško (1), Beto (0), Solanke (2). Your strikers combined for less than a sub goalkeeper. Mitoma (2), Gibbs-White (2), Cherki (1). Your midfield is a fart in the wind. Ndoye (7) was your one bright spot — but even he probably asked his agent to get him transferred out of your squad.

Your defense is Kerkez (1), Aina (1), Livramento (4). That’s not solid, that’s soft serve. Palmer (0) rotting on your bench sums it up. 8th place is generous — you’re just Sean’s charity case. Rename to cunha believe how garbage I am.

---

**Noah “Trophies Matter FC” Wilson – 21 pts (3 pts total, 9th place)**

Noah, you disgrace. 21 points. Trophies Matter FC? More like Participation Ribbons Matter. Watkins (2), Robertson (0), Stones (1), Mac Allister (0). That’s not a defense, that’s a public health hazard.

Neto (7) gave you a shred of dignity, Richarlison (4) tried, but it’s like putting lipstick on a pig. Henderson (2) in goal was tragic. Your bench was Garnacho (1), Khusanov (2), Kiwior (0). Dust. Absolute dust.

Bottom three and fully deserved. Trophy cabinet’s emptier than your forward line’s contributions.

---

**Zryan “FootAndBallFetish” Bhao – 39 pts (0 pts total, 10th place)**

Zryan, 39 points and still winless. You lost to a slimy slug. That’s legacy-defining humiliation.

Ekitiké (9), Ndiaye (8), Iwobi (7) actually balled. And then Gordon dropped –2 like a clown, Kilman gave you 0, Guessand 1, Piroe 1. Your fetish isn’t football, it’s public humiliation. Negative points on your squad in 2025? Bro, sell the team.

10th place, no wins, pure vibes. Rename to FeetAndFailure.

---

**Don “son4lyfe” Kim – 26 pts (0 pts total, 11th place)**

Don, your team is a crime against humanity. 26 points. Bruno Fernandes (2) was your “star.” Mateta (2), Thiago (2), Rogers (2). That’s not a midfield, that’s a graveyard.

Your defense? Wan-Bissaka (0), Hume (1), Cash (2). They’re collecting single points like they’re ration stamps in a world war. Johnson (9) gave you your only real return. Zubimendi (3) and Mayenda (2) padded nothing.

You’re 11th because Peter exists. You’re the league’s bye week. Rename to son4tears.

---

**Peter “Peattle Pounders” Henze – 33 pts (0 pts total, 12th place)**

Peter, bottom of the barrel. Pounders? Bro, you’re the one getting pounded every week. 33 points, zero wins, permanent clown.

Vicario (9) and Gabriel (6) gave you a backbone, but the rest of your squad pissed it away. Konaté (0), Ballard (1), Malen (1), Anderson (2), Bowen (2), Evanilson (2). That’s not an attack, that’s a TikTok meme.

Your team sheet looks like a Bundesliga scrap heap. Wirtz (2) deserves better. Estêvão (5) probably wishes he was drafted by literally anyone else. You’re last, and you’ll stay last. Rename to Seattle Flounders because there’s no pounding going on here.
