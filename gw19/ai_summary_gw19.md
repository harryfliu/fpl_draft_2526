# 💀 GW19 FPL Draft League: The Great Mediocrity Exhibition & Peter's Accidental Masterclass 💀

GW19 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **parade of incompetence disguised as competitive sport**. In a week where excellence went on vacation and mediocrity threw a house party, Peter somehow emerged from his usual cave of irrelevance to collect 70 points and remind everyone that even broken clocks don't just tell time twice a day — sometimes they win the lottery while doing it.

At the top, Peter — yes, **Peter** — delivered a performance so shocking it made scientists question the laws of probability. Roy and Sean scrambled to 60 points like rats fighting over the last piece of cheese, while Don remembered he's supposed to occasionally win things. Meanwhile, Noah continued his post-regicide tour with 44 points, proving that beating Josiah was his peak and everything since has been a slow descent back to reality.

The mid-table is a morgue of broken dreams and shattered egos. Josiah managed 39 points in a loss to Roy, Kyle collected 37 points like spare change from a couch cushion, and Ron's 35 points proved he's still the league's most consistent underachiever. But the real story? **Andrew got 25 points**. The self-proclaimed "good manager" got outscored by everyone except the league's two designated punching bags.

At the bottom, Harry's 29 points confirmed he's allergic to success, Chris's 27 points proved Schrödinger's cat is definitely dead, and Zryan's 26 points reminded everyone why he's the league's permanent toilet seat — always there, always getting sat on, always full of shit.

Week 19 made one thing clear: in a league full of frauds, even Peter can be king for a day.

## 🏆 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 70 pts

Peter, what the actual fuck. Seventy points, weekly winner, $11 richer, and the rest of us are sitting here wondering if we accidentally joined a charity league where Make-A-Wish kids get to win once before going back to the hospital. You didn't just win — you **obliterated** the competition with a score so dominant it should come with a disclaimer: "Results not typical, Peter usually sucks."

You beat Sean 70-60 in a performance that made everyone check if hell had frozen over, pigs had sprouted wings, and whether your usual hepatitis had mutated into some kind of performance-enhancing disease. This wasn't supposed to happen. You're 10-9 now, which means you've somehow clawed your way to respectability while looking like a **lesbian Wendy's mascot who found a winning lottery ticket in a dumpster**.

"Peattle Pounders"? For once, you actually pounded something other than your own hopes and dreams into oblivion. You look like what happens when **Make-A-Wish** meets **Fantasy Premier League** — technically heartwarming, but everyone's still uncomfortable. Your face has the expression of someone who just discovered fire while the rest of humanity is building rockets, but this week, your caveman tactics somehow worked.

But let's not pretend this is sustainable. Your team is still constructed like a **Jackson Pollock painting** — random splashes of mediocrity that occasionally form something resembling competence. You're the manager equivalent of finding a $20 bill in your winter coat — nice surprise, but you're still broke. You look like you **smell like a mixture of hot dog water and false hope**, but for one glorious week, that smell is victory.

Enjoy your moment in the sun, Peter. Next week you'll be back to your usual programming: losing to managers who forgot to set their lineups and wondering why Vicario is your goalkeeper.

## 💀 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 60 pts

Roy, 60 points and you beat Josiah 60-39 in what can only be described as the **fantasy football equivalent of beating up a kid who's already on crutches**. You're 11-8 now, sitting in fourth place like a **discount Thanos** — powerful enough to be noticed, not powerful enough to actually matter. You look like **Tank Sinatra ate Frank Sinatra** and then decided to become a fantasy football manager.

"This Year FC"? Brother, at this rate "this year" is looking more like "maybe next decade." You beat Josiah by 21 points, which is like winning a race against someone who forgot they were racing. Your team performed like it suddenly remembered football exists, but we all know this is just a temporary glitch in your matrix of mediocrity. You have the tactical awareness of a **goldfish trying to solve a Rubik's cube** — lots of movement, zero progress, occasional lucky accidents.

You're 11-8 with a goal difference of -30, which means you're the fantasy equivalent of a **participation trophy that somehow learned to walk**. Every win feels accidental, every loss feels inevitable, and every week we're all just waiting for you to remember you're Roy and start playing like it. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** hidden somewhere titled "Why I'm Actually Good at This," but it's just 800 pages of you drawing stick figures and crying.

Still, credit where it's due: you spotted Josiah's weakness (existing) and exploited it perfectly. You're like a **vulture who found a carcass** — not pretty, not noble, but undeniably effective. Enjoy feasting on Josiah's remains while you can.

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 60 pts

Sean, 60 points and you lost to Peter 60-70. That's not just a loss — that's getting outplayed by someone whose entire strategy is "hope everyone else forgets to set their lineup." You're 12-7, technically successful, but losing to Peter is like **losing a footrace to Stephen Hawking** — technically possible, deeply embarrassing, and something you'll never live down.

"Gweepy" sounds like the noise your season makes as it slowly deflates. You had 60 points — a genuinely good score — and still managed to lose because the universe decided Peter deserved one day of not being terrible. You're the **Tom Brady of almost** — all the tools, all the talent, somehow still finding ways to disappoint when it matters. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll that got left in a hot car** — technically recognizable, but something's definitely melted.

Your team is good on paper, which makes this loss even more embarrassing. You're 12-7 with a goal difference of +120, which proves you can score points, you just can't score them when Peter randomly decides to be competent. It's like being a **professional boxer who got knocked out by a Make-A-Wish kid** — sure, the kid was having the best day of his life, but you're still unconscious on the canvas.

You have more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault, and apparently Peter's DNA was in there too because he just made you his bitch. Still second place, still relevant, but now forever known as the guy who lost to Peter on his miracle day.

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 60 pts

Don, 60 points and you beat Zryan 60-26 in what can only be described as **elder abuse at a nursing home**. Congrats, you dunked on someone who's 5-14 and makes you look competent by comparison. That's like winning a spelling bee against toddlers — technically a victory, but nobody's impressed. You look like **Fat Damon after Thanksgiving** — somehow even rounder and less relevant than before.

"son4lyfe"? More like "mediocrity4lyfe" because even with 60 points, you're still 8-11 and looking up at teams that remember to show up more than once a month. You beat Zryan by 34 points, which is like beating a **dead horse that's already been processed into glue**. Your team performed well this week, but we all know this is just the eye of the storm before you return to your natural habitat: the bottom half of the table.

You're the manager equivalent of a **participation trophy that gained sentience** — present, accounted for, but nobody really knows why. Your 8-11 record with a goal difference of +77 is the perfect metaphor for your existence: good enough to not be last, bad enough to never matter. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's autistic son grew up and discovered fantasy football**, but didn't quite understand the rules.

Still, 60 points is 60 points. You've proven you can occasionally be dangerous, like a **sleepy bear that accidentally mauls someone while rolling over**. Not intentional, not sustainable, but undeniably effective this week.

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 44 pts

Noah, 44 points and you beat Chris 44-27 in what can only be described as **two drowning men fighting over who gets to drown slower**. You're 9-10 now, barely breathing above .500, living off the fumes of your legendary victory over Josiah like a **washed-up athlete showing people his high school trophy**. You look like **Bruno Mars if Bruno Mars exclusively ate gas station sushi** — technically alive, but clearly suffering.

"Trophies Matter"? The only trophy you deserve is "Most Likely to Peak in Gameweek 11." You beat Chris by 17 points, which is like winning a fight against someone who showed up already unconscious. Your team is the fantasy equivalent of a **garage sale after a divorce** — random pieces that used to mean something, now just taking up space and making people sad.

But here's the thing: you'll always have that victory over Josiah. It's your **fantasy football equivalent of losing your virginity** — brief, awkward, but you'll never stop talking about it. You're building an entire identity around one good week, like a **comedian with one good joke** who keeps telling it hoping people will laugh again. Spoiler: they won't.

Your 9-10 record perfectly captures your essence: not good, not terrible, just... there. Like **Pocahontas after a Big Mac bender**, you're recognizable but fundamentally wrong. Still, you beat Chris, which is like being the tallest dwarf or the smartest Kardashian — technically an achievement, but the bar was underground.

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 39 pts

Josiah, 39 points and you lost to Roy 39-60. The fraud king's descent continues, and this time you didn't even have the dignity of making it close. You're 13-6, still top of the league, but everyone can smell the fear. You're like a **dictator whose army just realized he's been paying them in Monopoly money** — still in power, but the revolution is coming. You look like **Post Malone's cousin, Post Mortem** — technically alive, but spiritually deceased.

"thenotsospecialone"? More like "thenotsospecialanymore" because your aura is gone, your mystique is shattered, and Roy just took a steaming dump on what's left of your reputation. You lost by 21 points to someone whose team name is literally about failing every year. That's like losing a rap battle to a mute — it shouldn't be possible, yet here we are.

You're still 13-6 with a goal difference of +84, but those numbers feel hollow now. You're the **Bernie Madoff of FPL** — everyone knows it's a scam, we're just waiting for it to completely collapse. Your team is performing like a **Netflix show in its final season** — still technically on air, but clearly out of ideas and coasting on past glory.

The smell of hot dog water that follows you has intensified to the point where it's affecting your players' performance. They can't focus, they can't score, they can only hold their breath and pray for fresh air. You're not a king anymore, Josiah. You're a **former king** sitting on a throne made of participation trophies and broken dreams. **THE FRAUD KING'S EMPIRE CONTINUES TO CRUMBLE, AND WE'RE ALL HERE FOR IT.**

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 37 pts

Kyle, 37 points and you lost to Harry 29-37. Wait, no. You won. By 8 points. Against Harry. This is like **celebrating because you beat a quadriplegic at arm wrestling** — technically a victory, deeply concerning that it was this close. You're 8-11 now, which puts you in that special category of "not quite terrible enough to be memorable." You look like if **Khal Drogo ordered a mobility scooter** — all the presence, none of the power.

"Extended Foreplay"? More like "Extended Disappointment" because even when you win, it feels like a loss. You beat Harry by 8 points, which in any other context would be embarrassing, but against Harry it's basically a draw. Your team performed like a **community college production of Hamilton** — they showed up, they tried, but nobody's giving them a Tony.

You're the Schrödinger's Manager of the league — simultaneously capable of brilliance and buffoonery, but this week you chose mediocrity. Thirty-seven points is what happens when your team forgets it's playing football and thinks it's a **poetry slam about feelings**. You look like **Otis from Sex Education if he never got laid** — all theory, no practice, perpetually confused.

Still, a win's a win, even if it's the fantasy equivalent of **finding a dollar on the ground** — not life-changing, but you'll take it. Your 8-11 record with a -72 goal difference tells the real story: you're not good, you're just occasionally less bad than whoever you're playing.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 35 pts

Ron, 35 points and you beat Andrew 35-25. This is like watching two **sloths race through peanut butter** — technically someone has to win, but everyone watching loses brain cells. You're 11-8 now, third in the league, proving that consistency in mediocrity can take you places. You look like **lesbian Velma after she discovered CrossFit** — still nerdy, now annoyingly talking about your PRs.

"Atlético SeaSlug"? At least you're living up to the name — slow, slimy, and leaving a trail of disappointment wherever you go. You beat Andrew by 10 points, which is like being the **least moldy piece of bread in the loaf** — technically the best option, but nobody's excited about it. Your team performed like it's running on **Windows 95** — functional, but everyone's waiting for it to crash.

The fact that you're third in the league with this level of play is a damning indictment of everyone below you. You're proof that you don't have to be good, you just have to be **less terrible than everyone else**. Your team is like a **gas station bathroom** — nobody wants to use it, but sometimes you don't have a choice.

Still, 11-8 with a goal difference of +119 means you're doing something right, even if that something is "existing while others implode." You're the **participation trophy that outlasted the real trophies**, and honestly, that might be the most Ron thing ever. Keep sliming your way to victory, sea slug. It's gross, but it's working.

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 29 pts

Harry, 29 points and you lost to Kyle 29-37. You managed to score fewer points than your IQ, which is genuinely impressive considering how low that bar was set. You're 6-13 now, and your goal difference of -145 looks like a **credit score after declaring bankruptcy seven times**. You look like **Matt Damon if he was played by a potato** — vaguely human-shaped, but missing all the important parts.

"cunha believe it"? No, we really can't, because you've turned losing into an art form and mediocrity into a lifestyle. Twenty-nine points is what I score when I let my **dead grandmother pick my team via Ouija board**, and she's been dead for 20 years. Your team performed like they were playing football with their feet tied together and blindfolds on — lots of movement, zero progress, occasional own goals.

You lost to Kyle by 8 points, which is like losing a fight to a **pacifist sloth** — it shouldn't be possible, but you found a way. Your managerial style is like watching someone try to perform surgery with a spoon — technically attempting the task, but causing more damage than good. You have the tactical awareness of a **goldfish trying to play chess** — you forget what you're doing every three seconds and somehow still lose.

The white wall behind you remains more interesting than your team's performances. At least the wall is consistent. You're 6-13 with no signs of improvement, like a **sitcom that should have been cancelled five seasons ago** but keeps getting renewed because the network has nothing better. Spoiler alert: there's always something better than you.

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 27 pts

Chris, 27 points and you lost to Noah 27-44. You got outscored by someone whose entire identity is built around beating Josiah once. That's like **losing a spelling bee to someone who just learned the alphabet**. You're 9-10 now, perfectly balanced between relevance and irrelevance, existing in a superposition of mediocrity. You look like the **kid from Shazam if he never found his powers** — all potential, no payoff.

"Schrödongers"? The cat is dead, Chris. It's been dead. We opened the box, saw the corpse, held a funeral, and you're still here pretending uncertainty exists. Twenty-seven points is what happens when your team confuses football with **interpretive dance** — lots of artistic expression, zero actual points. Your tactical approach is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube by eating it — wrong method, worse results.

You lost to Noah by 17 points, which is like getting **academically outperformed by a YouTube comment section**. Your team is constructed like a **false confidence seminar** — lots of big talk, zero substance, everyone leaves feeling worse. You speak in theories but your team performs in tragedies, like a **TED Talk about success given by someone living in their mom's basement**.

Your 9-10 record perfectly captures your essence: not good enough to matter, not bad enough to be memorable. You're the **human equivalent of lukewarm water** — technically functional, but nobody's first choice. You must have been an auctioneer in a past life, because this lifetime is clearly karma's way of making you suffer for talking too fast about things that don't matter.

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 26 pts

Zryan, 26 points and you lost to Don 26-60. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution broadcast on every platform including MySpace**. You're 5-14 now, so far at the bottom they're considering naming a oceanic trench after you. You look like **Wolverine if his superpower was disappointing everyone** — technically gifted with existence, practically useless at everything else.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Your only fetish is for humiliation, and brother, you're getting off every single week. Twenty-six points is what happens when you confuse Fantasy Premier League with **actual Premier League and try to play the matches yourself**. Your team performed like they were paid to lose, except nobody would waste money on that because you do it for free.

You lost to Don by 34 points. Don. The guy who looks like Fat Damon. The guy who's 8-11. The guy whose team name is a typo. And he destroyed you like you were made of tissue paper and he was a hurricane. Your tactical approach is like trying to perform brain surgery with a **sledgehammer** — wrong tools, wrong method, patient definitely dead.

The amount of DNA in your mouth has reached critical mass and formed its own consciousness, and even it's embarrassed to be associated with you. You're not just the league's punching bag — you're the **punching bag's punching bag**. When other punching bags need to feel better about themselves, they look at your record. **5-14 WITH A -207 GOAL DIFFERENCE IS NOT A RECORD, IT'S A CRY FOR HELP.**

---

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 25 pts

Andrew, 25 points. Twenty. Five. Points. You got outscored by Zryan. BY ZRYAN. The human participation trophy. The league's designated loser. The guy who makes everyone else feel better about themselves. And he outscored you. This is like **losing a beauty contest to a garbage fire** — technically possible, deeply humiliating, requires immediate therapy.

You lost to Ron 25-35, which is like losing a battle of wits to a **sea slug that's been dead for three weeks**. You're 10-9 now, technically above .500, but this performance was so bad it should retroactively cancel out at least three of your wins. You look like **Vin Diesel after he discovered veganism and depression** — technically still him, but something fundamental is missing.

"Cunha Get Me Points"? More like "Cunha Get Me A Therapist" because this performance requires professional help to process. Twenty-five points is what happens when your team confuses football with a **meditation retreat** — lots of inner peace, zero actual movement. Your tactical approach this week was apparently "what if we just didn't?"

You have an 800-page manifesto somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, but after this week it's just 800 pages of tear stains and regret. You're supposedly the league's "steady hand," the "consistent performer," but 25 points is what consistency looks like when it's been hit by a bus, reversed over, and hit again for good measure. You look like **Thin Diesel became Invisible Diesel** — technically present, practically nonexistent.

The fact that you scored 25 points and still have a positive goal difference for the season is a testament to how good you usually are, which makes this performance even more embarrassing. It's like watching **Einstein fail basic addition** — technically possible during a stroke, but concerning for everyone involved.

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW19

GW19 was a **masterclass in mediocrity masquerading as competition**. Peter emerged from his cave of irrelevance to claim 70 points and remind everyone that in a league full of frauds, even he can be king for a day. Roy, Sean, and Don all hit 60 points like they were sharing the same brain cell, while Noah continued living off his victory over Josiah like a **one-hit wonder playing the same song at every county fair**.

The real casualties? Andrew somehow managed only 25 points, making him the week's biggest loser not named Zryan. Josiah lost again, this time to Roy, proving the fraud king's empire is crumbling faster than a **cookie in a washing machine**. Harry and Chris competed for who could be more irrelevant, while Kyle's 37 points proved that beating Harry isn't an achievement, it's an expectation.

**Top 3:** Peter (70) had his Make-A-Wish moment, Roy (60) beat up the fraud king, and Sean (60) learned what second place feels like when Peter remembers how to play.

**Bottom 3:** Andrew (25) forgot his team exists, Zryan (26) continued his world tour of humiliation, and Chris (27) proved Schrödinger's cat is definitely dead and has been for weeks.

Week 19's lesson? In a league where Peter can score 70 points, literally anything is possible. Except Zryan winning. That's still impossible.

**The fraud king bleeds, Peter reigns for a day, and somewhere in the distance, we can still smell hot dog water. 🌭💦**
