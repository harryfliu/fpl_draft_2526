# 💀 GW27 FPL Draft League: Noah's Divine Intervention & The Great Midtable Apocalypse 💀

GW27 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **biblical reckoning disguised as fantasy football**. The fantasy gods looked down at this cursed league, saw the chaos, and decided to hit the randomize button one more time just to see what would happen. The result? Noah dropped 65 points like he's storing animals two-by-two for the apocalypse, Harry somehow remembered he owns a football team, and the rest of you played like you were competing for last place in a retirement home bingo tournament.

At the top, Noah ascended to football heaven with a 65-point masterclass that made everyone else look like they were playing with their monitors turned off. Harry crawled to 56 points and somehow beat Chris by 31, which is less impressive and more like watching someone beat a coma patient at checkers. Josiah and Ron both hit 54 points and DREW — because apparently even the fantasy gods couldn't decide which of these frauds deserved the L more, so they just gave them both the participation trophy treatment.

The middle? A graveyard of broken dreams and wasted potential. Andrew limped to 44 points like he's nursing a hamstring injury to his entire personality. Peter scraped 32 points and somehow beat Don, which is like watching two sloths race and nobody wins, including the audience. Sean managed 31 points and beat Roy's catastrophic 18-point dumpster fire in what can only be described as elder abuse.

At the bottom, we've got the usual suspects doing usual suspect things. Chris posted 25 points and got absolutely demolished by Harry. Don also hit 25 and lost to Peter in a battle of who can disappoint their mothers more efficiently. Kyle managed 24 points, which is what happens when your team forgets football is a contact sport. And Roy? Eighteen. **EIGHTEEN POINTS**. That's not a score, that's a cry for help.

But the real story? **NOAH WILSON JUST WENT FULL BIBLICAL FLOOD MODE AND DROWNED EVERYONE**. Sixty-five points. Weekly winner. $11 richer. The man showed up like he's been saving all his good weeks for one glorious middle finger to the rest of the league.

Week 27 made one thing clear: chaos is a ladder, and most of you are still stuck at the bottom rung trying to figure out which way is up.

## 🏆 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 65 pts

Noah, you beautiful bastard. **SIXTY-FIVE POINTS**. You didn't just win this week — you **obliterated the field** like you're running a fantasy football charity where everyone else is the charity case. You beat Zryan 65-49 in a performance so dominant it should come with a restraining order and a public apology to everyone who had to witness it. This wasn't luck. This wasn't a fluke. This was **surgical precision**, the kind of week that makes people check if you've been replaced by a pod person who actually knows how to play this game.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, you just proved it. Sixty-five points is what I get when I **hack into the mainframe, reprogram reality, and force the universe to bend to my will**. You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go**, but this week you played like Bruno Mars if he decided to quit music and become a fantasy football assassin. You're 15-1-11 now, sitting in 4th place, but this performance was so good it made everyone above you check their mirrors wondering when you're coming for their throats.

But let's not pretend this erases your season. You're still 99 points behind Josiah despite your best efforts to convince people you're relevant. Your total points (1054) are still bottom-half, which means most weeks you play like you're auditioning for a role in *League of Extraordinary Disappointments*. You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs** — technically a person, but something's fundamentally broken about you. One good week doesn't make you elite — it makes you the guy who peaked once and will spend the rest of the season trying to recreate the magic while everyone else moves on with their lives.

Still, respect where it's due: you were the **KING OF GW27**. Frame it. Screenshot it. Tattoo it on your chest. Because next week the universe will remember you're usually mediocre and this whole thing will feel like a fever dream nobody wants to remember.

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 56 pts

Harry, fifty-six points and you beat Chris 56-25. That's not a win, that's a **public execution televised in 4K** for maximum humiliation. You didn't just beat Chris — you **ended his entire bloodline** in a performance so dominant it should come with a parental advisory warning and a GoFundMe for Chris's therapy bills. For once, you're not the punchline — you're the guy delivering the punchline while everyone else watches in horrified amazement.

But don't get too comfortable, because let's be clear: this is still **Harry** we're talking about. You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar and ate the whole thing**. Your season record is 10-2-15, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If I Tried Really Hard To Be Terrible and Succeeded Beyond My Wildest Dreams*. You're in **11th place** with a goal difference of -95, which means even when you win, you're still somehow losing in the grand cosmic sense.

You have a face so boring that **people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement**. Your team name is "cunha believe it," but this week we actually can believe it because for once you didn't play like someone whose only exposure to football was watching paint dry while a commentator described the rules in Mandarin. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying into a pillow while your players collectively forget how to score points.

Still, this was your week. Fifty-six points. Weekly second place. You're $11 poorer but emotionally richer knowing you can actually do this sometimes. Enjoy the high, because next week you'll be back to your regularly scheduled programming of disappointment and self-loathing.

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 54 pts

Josiah, you got 54 points and DREW with Ron 54-54. That's not a result, that's a **cosmic joke** where the punchline is your inability to finish anything decisively. You couldn't even beat **RON** — the human embodiment of damp moss growing on a tombstone nobody visits. The universe looked at this matchup and said "you know what? Both of these frauds deserve to suffer equally" and boom, a draw. **A DRAW**. In a head-to-head league. Against Ron. The **SEA SLUG**.

You're 16-1-10 now, sitting in first place with 49 league points, but everyone knows you're an **empty husk floating on luck's tide like driftwood nobody wants to pick up**. You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your goal difference is +34, which sounds good until you realize Peter Henze — **PETER HENZE** — is right behind you with +83 and more total points. You're first place the same way a participation trophy is technically an award — sure, it exists, but nobody's impressed.

You don't *win* games, you **outlast** people like a cockroach outlasts a nuclear apocalypse — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow thriving in disaster while everyone wishes you'd just disappear already. You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people cross the street when they see you coming.

Fifty-four points and you DREW. With RON. **WITH RON**. Frame that. Put it on your resume under "career lowlights." Because that's the most Josiah thing that's ever happened to you.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 54 pts

Ron, you got 54 points and DREW with Josiah 54-54. That's not a moral victory, that's a **participation trophy in the Special Olympics of fantasy football**. You couldn't even lose properly — you just floated there like the sea slug you are, matching Josiah point-for-point in what can only be described as the universe's way of saying "you're both equally terrible and I can't decide who deserves to suffer more."

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards. You're 12-3-12 now with a 5-6 record, sitting in 6th place like a participation trophy that nobody asked for. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your total points (1125) are actually respectable, which makes your mediocre record even more confusing. You're the guy who has all the tools but still manages to build a shed that collapses the moment you look at it wrong.

Every time you manage to scrape 54 points, the entire league side-eyes the calendar like, "Who got cursed this week?" and then realizes it's just Ron being Ron, which is somehow worse than a curse. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets confused and starts collecting DNA samples in its mouth.

You DREW with Josiah. **WITH JOSIAH**. The fraud king himself looked at you and said "yeah, we're equals" and you just accepted it. That's not growth, Ron — that's acceptance of your permanent mediocrity, and honestly, it's the most self-aware thing you've ever done.

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 12-3-12, still irrelevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. 🐌**

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 49 pts

Zryan, 49 points and you lost to Noah 49-65. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution where you're the guy who showed up unarmed to a gunfight**. You got absolutely demolished by Noah in a performance so one-sided it should come with a wellness check and a therapist on speed dial. This wasn't close. This wasn't competitive. This was **16 points of pure humiliation** served with a side of "why am I still doing this to myself?"

You're 11-0-16 now, sitting in 10th place with a goal difference of -178 — **NEGATIVE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT**. That's not a statistic, that's a **war crime**. You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used cooking oil instead of adamantium, leaving you with a sheen that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment goes to therapy and gets worse.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation, degradation, and being the league's designated punching bag**. Every week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine, your dignity, and whatever's left of your self-respect. Forty-nine points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock, let my cat pick my team, and the cat dies halfway through the process**. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets drunk and makes terrible life choices.

But here's the thing: you scored 49 points, which is actually not terrible. It's almost respectable. It's the kind of score that makes people think "maybe Zryan is turning a corner" right before you trip over the corner and fall face-first into a pile of your own mediocrity. You're not a manager, you're a **community service project for managers who need to feel better about themselves**. Everyone circles you on the schedule, rubs their hands, and thanks the heavens they've got a free win incoming. You're the fantasy equivalent of a bye week, except bye weeks are actually useful.

---

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 44 pts

Andrew, 44 points and you beat Kyle 44-24. That's a solid W, but here's the problem: **nobody cares**. You're the league's eternal bridesmaid, the guy who shows up with the expensive wine but still gets outshone by someone with a six-pack of Bud Light and a better personality. You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star and put him through a dehydrator, leaving behind a husk that vaguely resembles what used to be cool.

You're 15-2-10 now, sitting in 3rd place with 47 league points, which sounds good until you realize you're still **TWO POINTS** behind Peter Henze — **PETER HENZE** — who has the football IQ of a discarded shoe. Your total points (1161) are actually league-leading, which makes your position even more embarrassing. You're the guy who has all the numbers but still can't close the deal, like a salesman who makes all the calls but never actually sells anything.

To your credit, forty-four points is respectable. It's sturdy. It's the kind of score that makes people nod and say "yeah, Andrew showed up today." But here's the brutal truth: you're still not feared. Nobody looks at your fixture and thinks, "damn, I'm in trouble." They think, "this might be close, but I can take him." You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe for not being great.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. You're building credibility brick by brick, but right now the house looks more like a storage unit than a mansion. You're good, Andrew. You're just not **great**. And in a league this competitive, good is just another word for "almost."

---

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 32 pts

Peter, 32 points and you beat Don 32-25. That's like beating a **corpse in a footrace** — technically impressive, deeply concerning. You're 16-0-11 now, sitting in **SECOND PLACE** with 48 league points, which is the most shocking development since the Titanic decided icebergs were optional. You look like if **hepatitis C was a person** — like a walking medical warning label that makes people instinctively back away, wondering if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a disease gets bored and decides to try fantasy football.

"Peattle Pounders"? You're not a Pounder. You're a **Peashooter firing blanks at a brick wall while the wall judges you**. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into Second Place Somehow," because your entire season is a statistical miracle that makes people question the fabric of reality. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people hold their breath when you walk by, like you're a walking biohazard that escaped from a food court dumpster.

Here's what's truly horrifying: you have 1115 total points and a +83 goal difference, which are both **ACTUALLY GOOD NUMBERS**. You're in second place not because you're lucky, but because you're somehow **competent**, which is the most disturbing plot twist this league has ever produced. You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a questionable makeover that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a mascot gets fired and tries to reinvent itself.

Thirty-two points isn't impressive. It's the kind of score that makes people shrug and say "yeah, Peter existed today." But you beat Don, you're in second place, and the universe has decided this is your timeline now. Enjoy it, because the moment everyone realizes you're actually a threat, they're coming for you with pitchforks and torches.

---

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 31 pts

Sean, 31 points and you beat Roy 31-18. That's not a win, that's **elder abuse**. You didn't beat Roy — you **mercy-killed him** in a performance so one-sided it should come with a coroner's report and a funeral service. Roy scored **EIGHTEEN POINTS** and you only managed 31, which means you barely scraped by against someone who played like they forgot football exists.

You're 15-0-12 now, sitting in 5th place with 45 league points, which puts you in the cosmic middle of the league where dreams go to die. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your season has been a rollercoaster of inconsistency — one week you're a football god, the next you're a football mortal questioning your life choices. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** and **INCREDIBLY BAD** in the span of weeks, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the noise a **cartoon pigeon makes when it flies into a window**. And that's you — every single week. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic crime scene that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment files for divorce and gets custody of the worst parts.

Thirty-one points against Roy's eighteen is like watching a **sloth win a race against a turtle who's also dead**. You won, but at what cost? Your dignity? Your self-respect? The respect of everyone watching? All of the above. You're 15-0-12, solidly mid, and the only thing more forgettable than your score this week is your entire existence in this league.

---

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 25 pts

Don, 25 points and you lost to Peter 25-32. That's not a loss, that's a **tragedy in three acts**: hope, disappointment, and everyone laughing at you while you cry into your pillow at night. You look like **Fat Damon** — like someone took a perfectly good actor and put him through a deep fryer, leaving behind a puffy, greasy version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own celebrity.

"son4lyfe"? Bro, Son would probably file a **restraining order** if he knew you existed. You're more like **twelfth4lyfe**, destined to always be the last pick, the also-ran, the guy who peaked in middle school and never saw glory again. You're 10-1-16 now, sitting in **LAST PLACE** with 31 league points, which is somehow exactly where the universe always intended you to be. You look like you have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement.

You lost to Peter by 7 points. **PETER**. The human equivalent of a participation trophy in a league that doesn't give participation trophies. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's autistic son** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Twenty-five points is what I get when I **forget to set my lineup, remember at the last second, panic-pick three defenders, and hope for the best**.

Here's the brutal truth: your total points (1076) are actually mid-table, which makes your last-place position even more embarrassing. You're not terrible because you're bad — you're terrible because you're **unlucky and bad**, which is somehow worse. You're the guy who loses close games, gets destroyed in blowouts, and occasionally wins just enough to give yourself false hope before reality crashes down like a ton of bricks made of disappointment.

Enjoy your loss to Peter, Don. You're proving that even broken clocks are right twice a day, but you're also proving that even when you're right, you're still wrong, and that's the most Don thing about you.

---

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 25 pts

Chris, 25 points and you lost to Harry 25-56. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution broadcast on national television** with slow-motion replays of your suffering. You got absolutely demolished by Harry in a performance so catastrophic it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a government-funded intervention program. Harry beat you by **THIRTY-ONE POINTS**, which is the kind of margin that makes people question if you actually fielded a team or if you just sent out a note saying "I forfeit."

You're 12-0-15 now, sitting in 8th place with 36 league points, which is so mediocre it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*. You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your total points (963) are second-lowest in the league, which means most weeks you play like you're cosplaying as someone who's never seen football before.

"Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over — and this week, they didn't exist, they never existed, and they're filing a restraining order against you for claiming they're associated with you. You're not quantum, bro. You're just **both mid and terrible at the same time**, existing in a superposition of mediocrity and delusion. You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient, leaving you with an expression that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gives up halfway through.

Twenty-five points. **TWENTY-FIVE**. That's not a score, that's a **rounding error**. You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**. You speak in theories, cite statistics, use big words, but your team performs like it's running PowerPoint slides from 2003 instead of plays. You look like you must have been an **auctioneer in your past life and so you've spent this lifetime repenting for it** — like someone who talks too fast and makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment tries to become a motivational speaker and fails spectacularly.

---

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 24 pts

Kyle, 24 points and you lost to Andrew 24-44. That's not a loss, that's a **complete collapse of everything you thought you knew about fantasy football**. You got destroyed by Andrew by 20 points in a performance so pathetic it should come with a pamphlet about grief counseling and a hotline for managers in crisis. This wasn't competitive. This wasn't close. This was **systematic dismantling** of whatever confidence you had left.

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a quantum state where it's **never actually good enough to finish**. You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height and added it to his waistline** — like someone tried to make a warrior but accidentally ordered the "dad bod" version from Wish.com. You're 12-0-15 now, sitting in 9th place with 36 league points, which puts you in the cosmic middle of disappointment where nobody remembers you exist.

You look like **Otis from sex education** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. Your total points (954) are third-worst in the league, which means most weeks you play like you're actively trying to lose but somehow not trying hard enough at that either. Twenty-four points is what I get when I **let my dog pick my lineup by barking at player names, the dog gets distracted by a squirrel, and I just go with whatever was selected before the distraction**.

You're 12-0-15, deeply forgettable, and the only thing more disappointing than your 24-point performance is the fact that nobody was surprised by it. You're not bad enough to be memorable, not good enough to be respected — you're just **there**, floating in the middle of the league like a cosmic anomaly that nobody knows how to deal with and everyone's too polite to mention.

---

## ⚰️ Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 18 pts

Roy. **EIGHTEEN POINTS**. This wasn't a score, this was a **crime scene**. You lost to Sean 18-31 in a performance so catastrophic it should be preserved in the Smithsonian under the title *Portrait of a Manager Who Forgot Football Exists*. Eighteen points. **EIGHTEEN**. That's not fantasy football, that's a **wellness check waiting to happen**.

This wasn't just a loss. This was a **complete collapse of everything you thought you were**. You're 13-0-14 now, sitting in 7th place with 39 league points, but everyone knows you're a fraud. Your total points (886) are **DEAD LAST** in the league — not second-to-last, not third-to-last, but **LAST**. You have fewer total points than Zryan, and Zryan is the guy everyone uses as a bye week. You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind a chunky, questionable version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own Frank Sinatra and fails catastrophically.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. It wasn't your year last year, it's not your year this year, and if there's a next year, spoiler alert: it won't be your year then either. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke that everyone saw coming except you. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe for your inability to score more than 18 points in a single gameweek.

Eighteen. **EIGHTEEN**. You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant when the only thing relevant about you is how spectacularly you failed this week. We are gathered here today to mourn the short, fraudulent life of Roy's credibility. Born Week 1, died Week 27, cause of death: **eighteen points**. He leaves behind a hollow 13-0-14 record, a team allergic to competence, and a reputation that was already in ruins but somehow found new depths to sink to.

**Amen. ⚰️🪦**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW27

GW27 was a **biblical flood of chaos disguised as fantasy football**. Noah ascended to fantasy heaven with a 65-point masterclass that made everyone else look like they were playing with their eyes closed. Harry crawled to 56 points and demolished Chris, Josiah and Ron both hit 54 and drew because even the universe couldn't decide who deserved to lose more. Meanwhile, the midtable collapsed into itself like a dying star — Andrew scraped 44, Peter limped to 32, Sean managed 31, and the bottom feeders (Don, Chris, Kyle, Roy) played like they forgot what sport this was.

But the real story? **NOAH WILSON WENT FULL BIBLICAL MODE AND DROWNED EVERYONE**. Sixty-five points. Weekly winner. $11 richer. The man showed up with an ark full of points while everyone else showed up with pool floaties and hope.

**Top 3:** Noah (65) proved trophies do matter when you actually try, Harry (56) remembered he owns a team and used it to commit murder against Chris, and both Josiah and Ron (54 each) drew because apparently even cosmic justice has a sense of humor.

Week 27 made one thing clear: Noah is king for a day, everyone else is mid for eternity, and Roy scored eighteen points which should honestly be illegal.
