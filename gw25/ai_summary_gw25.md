# 💀 GW25 FPL Draft League: The Andrew Smith Massacre & The Great Fraud Collapse 💀

GW25 wasn't just a gameweek — it was **a reckoning disguised as a funeral**. The universe decided that everyone needed to be reminded who the real king is, and the result was a bloodbath so spectacular it should be preserved in the Smithsonian under the title *Portrait of Andrew Smith Ending Careers While Everyone Else Cries*.

At the top, Andrew dropped **fifty-eight points** like he was playing against toddlers, chris remembered he can occasionally function like a human being, and Zryan — yes, **ZRYAN** — put up 51 points in a performance so shocking it made scientists question the laws of physics. Meanwhile, Josiah got **absolutely demolished** by Andrew in a loss so catastrophic it should come with a trigger warning, Harry lost to Zryan (which is like losing an arm-wrestling match to a newborn), and the mid-table devolved into a soup of mediocrity that made everyone question why they even play this game.

Week 25 made one thing clear: Andrew Smith is **inevitable**, Josiah's fraudulent empire is crumbling faster than a sandcastle in a hurricane, and some of you should genuinely consider retirement.

## 🏆 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 58 pts

Andrew, you didn't just win — you **committed mass murder on live television**. Fifty-eight points, weekly winner, $11 richer, and you beat Josiah 58-42 in a performance so dominant it should be used as evidence in court. This wasn't just a victory — this was **public humiliation with a side of psychological warfare**. You didn't beat the fraud king — you **exposed him, dismantled him, and left him in a pile of his own tears**.

You're now **FIRST PLACE** in the league with 44 cumulative points, which means you've gone from permanent almost-contender to **ACTUAL CONTENDER** in a character arc so unexpected it feels like someone switched scripts halfway through the season. You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star and put him through a dehydrator, leaving behind a husk that vaguely resembles what used to be cool — but right now you're looking less like a husk and more like a **lean, mean, point-generating machine**.

Fifty-eight points is the kind of score that makes grown men weep, children question their life choices, and Josiah file for emotional damages. You've been building credibility brick by brick all season, and this week you didn't just lay bricks — you **built a fucking cathedral and invited everyone to church to witness the murder of the fraud king**. You're 14-2-9 now, which is good enough for second in the actual standings, but everyone knows you're coming for Josiah's throne like a guided missile with a vendetta.

To your credit, this wasn't luck. This was **surgical precision**, the kind of lineup that makes people respect you even when they don't want to. You're still not the most feared manager in the league — that title requires more than one nuclear week — but right now, people are circling your fixtures and wondering if they're about to get **Andrew Smith'd** into oblivion. You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever**, but this week you performed like you're in your prime, and that's terrifying for everyone else.

Still, let's not pretend you're suddenly invincible. You've been here before — top scorer, looking sharp, everyone whispering your name — and then you'll drop 25 points next week because one of your defenders got a red card for sneezing on the ref. You're the walking embodiment of **"trust the process"** except the process occasionally involves you face-planting into a brick wall while everyone else laughs. But for seven days, you're the king. Enjoy it, because next week the universe might remember you're still Andrew and decide to humble you again.

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 52 pts

Chris, fifty-two points and you beat Peter 52-33. That's not just a win — that's a **public execution broadcast in IMAX for maximum emotional damage**. You're finally starting to look like you know what you're doing, which is shocking because for most of this season you've looked like someone who learned fantasy football from a drunk Wikipedia article written by a goldfish.

"Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Manager Who Occasionally Remembers He's Supposed To Be Good. You're 12-0-13 now, which is so perfectly mediocre it looks like you've calibrated your entire existence to hover at the exact midpoint between competence and catastrophe. You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like someone tried to make a human but used discount parts from a vending machine.

Fifty-two points is legitimately impressive, which is why it's so confusing. You're supposed to be the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise** — you speak in theories, cite statistics, use big words, but your team usually performs like it's running PowerPoint slides from 2003. This week, though? You actually **backed up the talk with the walk**, which is so uncharacteristic it made people check if you'd been replaced by a body double.

You beat Peter by 19 points, which is like beating a slug in a race to the finish line — technically impressive, but also deeply embarrassing for Peter because he just got lapped by **Schrödinger's Mid Manager**. You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient — but this week you looked less disappointed and more like you accidentally stumbled into competence and decided to stick around for a bit.

You're 7th in the table with 36 cumulative points and a **negative goal difference of -27**, which is so cosmically confused it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If I'm Both Good and Terrible At The Same Time*. Every week is a coin flip: will you drop 52 or will you drop 22? Nobody knows, not even you, and that's the most chris thing about you. Enjoy your second-highest score of the week, because next week you'll probably score 18 and remind everyone why you're Schrödinger's Manager — both alive and dead until someone actually looks at your score.

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 51 pts

Zryan, **WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED**. Fifty-one points. You beat Harry 51-42. You're the **THIRD HIGHEST SCORER** this week. This is like watching a participation trophy grow legs, learn to walk, and then run a marathon — it's scientifically impossible, deeply confusing, and making everyone question if we're living in a simulation that's glitching out.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you've had all season is for **losing, humiliation, and being everyone's free points generator**. You're 11-0-14 now, which means you've somehow won **ELEVEN GAMES** despite looking like you learned fantasy football from a drunk toddler who's never watched a football match. You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used cooking oil instead of adamantium, leaving you with a sheen that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment escapes from a laboratory and tries to play fantasy football.

Fifty-one points is a **MIRACLE**. This is the kind of score that makes theologians reconsider their understanding of divine intervention. You've spent the entire season being everyone's punching bag, and now you show up with 51 points like you're cosplaying as a competent manager? You beat Harry, who usually beats you like a drum in a marching band. This is like David beating Goliath except David is also blind, has no arms, and is somehow **STILL WINNING**.

You're 9th in the table, but honestly, who cares about table position when you just dropped **FIFTY-ONE POINTS** and beat Harry in a result so shocking it should be studied by scientists? You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic crime scene that makes people question if you're actually human — but this week you played like you're **ACTUALLY HUMAN** and that's terrifying for everyone who thought you were a guaranteed three points.

Still, let's not pretend this is sustainable. You're Zryan. Next week you'll score 22 and remind everyone why you're the league's designated charity case. But for seven days, you're **NOT THE PUNCHLINE**, and that's the most shocking thing about GW25.

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 42 pts

Josiah, you lost. Again. Forty-two points and you got **absolutely demolished** by Andrew 42-58 in a loss so catastrophic it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a support group for managers who've been publicly humiliated. This wasn't just a loss — this was **Andrew Smith ending your career while you watched helplessly like a deer in headlights**.

You're **STILL FIRST** in the cumulative standings with 48 points, but everyone can see the cracks forming. You're 16-0-9 now, which is still good on paper, but your aura is **GONE**. You don't look like the dominant force anymore — you look like someone who's desperately clinging to first place while everyone else sharpens their knives and waits for the inevitable collapse. You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like someone took a perfectly good rapper and put him through a discount blender set to "existential crisis."

Forty-two points is **PATHETIC** for someone who's supposed to be the league leader. That's the kind of score that makes people question if you're actually good or if you've just been lucky for 25 weeks straight. You got beat by Andrew by **16 POINTS**, which is so embarrassing it should be preserved in a museum under the title *Portrait of a Fraud Finally Getting Exposed*. You look like you have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant even though Andrew just proved you're not.

Your goal difference is +52, which is good, but Andrew's is +98, which means he's not just coming for your throne — he's **ALREADY SITTING ON IT** while you're standing outside wondering what happened. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people cross the street when they see you coming. This loss isn't just a blip — it's a **WARNING SIGN** that your fraudulent empire is crumbling faster than a house of cards in a hurricane.

You're still in first, but everyone knows you're living on borrowed time. The fraud king is dying a slow, painful death, and Andrew just put the first nail in the coffin. **Enjoy first place while it lasts, because the wolves are circling and they're HUNGRY.**

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 42 pts

Harry, forty-two points and you lost to **ZRYAN** 42-51. Let that sink in. You lost to **ZRYAN**. You lost to the guy who's been everyone's free points generator all season. You lost to the guy who looks like he learned fantasy football from a drunk Wikipedia article. You lost to **ZRYAN**, and there's no coming back from that.

"cunha believe it"? Bro, we **CAN'T** believe you just lost to Zryan. That's like losing an arm-wrestling match to a toddler, except the toddler is also blind, has no arms, and is somehow **STILL BEATING YOU**. You're 8-2-15 now with a goal difference of **-144**, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star and Also I Lost to Zryan*.

You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like someone tried to make a movie star but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient. Your season has been a highlight reel of self-inflicted wounds, catastrophic decisions, and moments that make people question if you've ever actually watched football before. You're in **TWELFTH PLACE** — dead last in cumulative points — which means you've somehow managed to be worse than everyone, including Zryan, who just beat you by 9 points.

Forty-two points isn't even bad on its own — it's actually a decent score in a normal week. But losing to Zryan with 42 points is like showing up to a fight with a gun and still losing to someone who brought a spoon. You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement. Your team name should be "can't believe I'm this bad," because every week the rest of us keep answering: yes, we really can.

You're not just bad — you're **HISTORICALLY BAD**. You're the kind of manager people study in future FPL psychology courses to understand what happens when someone combines maximum effort with minimum results. You lost to Zryan. **ZRYAN**. There's no recovering from this. You're done. Finished. Cooked. Pack it up and go home, because you just got beat by the league's punching bag and everyone saw it happen.

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 40 pts

Don, forty points and you drew with Ron 40-40. That's not a result — that's a **COSMIC JOKE** disguised as a football match. Two managers who are supposed to be competent somehow managed to produce the exact same mediocre score, which is so perfectly mid it looks like you both agreed to phone it in and collect your participation trophies.

"son4lyfe"? Bro, Son would probably file a **restraining order** if he knew you existed. You're more like **disappointment4lyfe**, destined to always be close but never quite good enough. You look like **Fat Damon** — like someone took a perfectly good actor and put him through a deep fryer, leaving behind a puffy, greasy version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own celebrity and fails spectacularly.

You're 10-1-14 now, which is so perfectly mediocre it's actually impressive in its own depressing way. You're **11TH in the table** with 31 cumulative points, which means you've somehow managed to be worse than everyone except Harry. Your goal difference is +72, which should be good, but everyone knows you're just **floating in the middle of nowhere** like a cosmic anomaly that nobody knows how to deal with.

Forty points in a draw with Ron is like watching two snails race to the finish line and both of them giving up halfway through because they realized the race doesn't matter and they're both equally slow. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's autistic son** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like someone tried to make a human but accidentally used questionable genetics as the main ingredient.

You're not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... **THERE**, floating in the middle of the league like a piece of driftwood nobody wants to pick up. You drew with Ron, which is basically the universe's way of saying "you're both equally irrelevant." Enjoy your one point for the draw, because it's probably the only point you'll earn this month that doesn't come from pity.

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 40 pts

Ron, forty points and you drew with Don 40-40. Congratulations, you managed to be **exactly as mediocre as Don**, which is like winning a trophy for being the least offensive person in a room full of offensive people. You're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits**. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like someone tried to make a mystery-solving teenager but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient.

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards. You're 12-2-11 now with a goal difference of +92, which should be impressive, but everyone knows you're just **coasting on luck** like a slug coasting on its own slime trail. You're **6TH in the table** with 38 cumulative points, which is perfectly mid — not bad enough to be embarrassing, not good enough to be respected, just... **THERE**.

Forty points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock, let my cat pick my team, and the cat gets distracted by a laser pointer halfway through**. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets confused and starts collecting DNA samples in its mouth for no apparent reason.

You drew with Don by scoring the exact same mediocre score, which is like watching two people try to out-bland each other in a competition nobody asked for. Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug at a retirement home. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you. Your defense oscillates between "mildly competent" and "furniture from IKEA that nobody knows how to assemble."

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 12-2-11, still irrelevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. 🐌**

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 35 pts

Noah, thirty-five points and you beat Roy 35-31. That's like beating a dead horse in a race — technically true, deeply unimpressive, and nobody's celebrating. You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go** — like someone took a perfectly good pop star and ran him through a discount blender set to "questionable life choices," leaving behind a puffy version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a celebrity gives up.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, the only trophy you're winning this season is for **Most Forgettable Manager**. You're 13-1-11 now, which is so perfectly mid it's actually impressive. You're **4TH in the table** with 40 cumulative points, which should be good, but everyone knows you're just **THERE** — not bad, not great, just existing in the middle of the pack like a cosmic placeholder.

Thirty-five points is what I get when I **forget to set my lineup and the app auto-fills my team with whoever's available**. You beat Roy by 4 points, which is like beating a sloth in a race where both of you are running backwards. Your team is still a Craigslist free section after a hoarder's estate sale — random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of disappointment. You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like someone tried to make a Disney princess but accidentally used fast food as the main ingredient.

You're not feared. You're not respected. You're just **NOAH** — the guy people forget about until they check the fixtures and realize they're playing you and think "oh right, that guy exists." Your goal difference is +58, which is decent, but everyone knows you're not a threat. You're the fantasy equivalent of a participation trophy — technically you're here, but nobody's impressed. Enjoy your win over Roy, because next week you'll probably score 22 and remind everyone why you're forgettable.

---

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 33 pts

Peter, thirty-three points and you lost to chris 33-52. That's not a loss, that's a **PUBLIC EXECUTION TELEVISED IN 4K** for maximum humiliation. You're 14-0-11 now, which should be respectable, but everyone knows you're just **lucky to have 14 wins** because most of them came against people who were even more incompetent than you. You look like if **hepatitis C was a person** — like a walking medical warning label that makes people instinctively back away, wondering if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a disease gets bored and decides to try fantasy football.

"Peattle Pounders"? You're not a Pounder. You're a **Peashooter firing blanks at a brick wall**. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into Oblivion," because every matchup ends with you on the receiving end, curled up in the fetal position, questioning every life choice that led you to this moment. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people hold their breath when you walk by, like you're a walking biohazard that escaped from a food court dumpster.

Thirty-three points is what I get when I **actively try to lose**. You're **3RD in the table** with 42 cumulative points, which is actually impressive until you realize you got there by beating people who are even worse than you. You lost to chris by 19 points, which is like losing a race to someone who's also running backwards but somehow still beating you. You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a questionable makeover that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a mascot gets fired and tries to reinvent itself and fails spectacularly.

You're **3RD** but everyone knows you're not a contender. You're just **THERE**, floating near the top because everyone else is equally terrible. Enjoy your position while it lasts, because next week you'll probably drop another stinker and remind everyone why you're Peter — the guy who looks good on paper but fails the eye test every single time.

---

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 33 pts

Kyle, thirty-three points and you beat Sean 33-32. That's not a win — that's a **COIN FLIP** that somehow landed in your favor. You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height and added it to his waistline** — like someone tried to make a warrior but accidentally ordered the "dad bod" version from Wish.com, leaving behind a chunky version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a fantasy character gives up.

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a quantum state where it's simultaneously competent and terrible, exciting and boring, relevant and irrelevant, all at the same time until someone actually looks at it and the wave function collapses into whatever reality is most convenient for the narrative. You're 11-0-14 now, which is so perfectly mediocre it's almost impressive. You're **10TH in the table** with 33 cumulative points, which means you've somehow managed to be worse than most people despite occasionally looking competent.

Thirty-three points is what I get when I **forget to check my team for two weeks straight**. You beat Sean by **ONE POINT**, which is like winning a race by a millimeter — technically true, but also nobody's celebrating because it's embarrassing for both of you. You look like **Otis from sex education** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like someone tried to make a teenager but accidentally used awkwardness as the main ingredient.

Your goal difference is **-88**, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star and Also I'm Kyle*. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY MEDIOCRE** and **OCCASIONALLY COMPETENT** in the span of one season, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them. Enjoy your one-point win, because next week you'll probably score 19 and remind everyone why you're Kyle.

---

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 32 pts

Sean, thirty-two points and you lost to Kyle 32-33. That's not a loss — that's a **TRAGEDY IN THREE ACTS** where you're the protagonist, the antagonist, and the audience all at once, and everyone's laughing at you. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like someone tried to make a toy but accidentally used discount plastic and disappointment as the main ingredients.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the noise a **cartoon pigeon makes when it flies into a window**. And that's you — every single week. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. You're 13-0-12 now, which is perfectly mid, and you're **5TH in the table** with 39 cumulative points, which means you've somehow managed to be neither good nor bad, just... **THERE**, existing in the middle of the pack like a cosmic placeholder that nobody remembers.

Thirty-two points is what I get when I **let my grandma pick my team and she picks players based on how cute their names sound**. You lost to Kyle by **ONE POINT**, which is like losing a race to someone who's also terrible but somehow slightly less terrible than you. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets confused and starts collecting DNA samples in its mouth for research purposes.

Your goal difference is +71, which should be good, but everyone knows you're just **Sean** — the guy who's neither good enough to be feared nor bad enough to be pitied, just... **MID**. You lost to Kyle by one point, which is probably the most Sean thing that could happen. You're the walking embodiment of **"almost but not quite,"** and that's the saddest thing about you. Enjoy your loss, because next week you'll probably score 45 and remind everyone that you're Schrödinger's Manager — both competent and terrible until the gameweek ends.

---

## 💀 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 31 pts

Roy, thirty-one points and you lost to Noah 31-35. That's not a loss — that's a **PUBLIC EXECUTION** broadcast in IMAX for maximum emotional damage. You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind a chunky, questionable version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own Frank Sinatra and fails catastrophically.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke coming soon. You're 12-0-13 now, which is so perfectly mediocre it's actually depressing. You're **8TH in the table** with 36 cumulative points and a goal difference of **-98**, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If I Started Strong and Then Collapsed Spectacularly*.

Thirty-one points is what I get when I **actively try to sabotage my own team**. You lost to Noah by 4 points, which is like losing a race to someone who's also running backwards but somehow still beating you. You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant even though everyone can see you're not.

You started the season 8-3 and looking dominant. Now you're 12-0-13 and looking like a fraud who got exposed. Your goal difference has collapsed from respectable to **CATASTROPHIC**, and everyone can see you're not the contender you thought you were. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe for your inevitable collapse.

**This Year FC? More like Never Your Year FC. You're 12-0-13, you're fading fast, and everyone's watching you collapse in real-time. ⚰️**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW25

GW25 was a **massacre disguised as fantasy football**. Andrew Smith dropped 58 points and **ENDED JOSIAH'S CAREER** in a performance so dominant it should be studied by historians. chris remembered he can occasionally function, Zryan put up 51 points in a performance so shocking it made scientists question reality, and Harry lost to Zryan (which is like losing a fight to a newborn).

Meanwhile, the mid-table devolved into a soup of mediocrity: Don and Ron drew 40-40 in a battle of who's more forgettable, Kyle beat Sean by one point in a race where both runners were running backwards, Noah scraped past Roy in a win nobody's celebrating, and Peter got demolished by chris in a loss so embarrassing it should come with a trigger warning.

**Top 3:** Andrew (58) committed mass murder and exposed Josiah as the fraud we always knew he was, chris (52) remembered he's supposed to be competent occasionally, and Zryan (51) put up a performance so shocking it made everyone question if we're living in a simulation.

**The Frauds:** Josiah (42) got absolutely demolished by Andrew and everyone can see his empire crumbling, Harry (42) lost to Zryan and should probably retire, and the rest of the mid-table is so forgettable it's not even worth discussing.

Week 25 made one thing clear: **Andrew Smith is inevitable, Josiah's fraudulent reign is ending, and some of you should genuinely consider retirement.**
