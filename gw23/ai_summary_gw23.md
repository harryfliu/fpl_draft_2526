# 💀 GW23 FPL Draft League: Peter's Coronation & The Great Standings Massacre 💀

GW23 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **cosmic realignment disguised as fantasy football**. The universe looked at the standings, laughed at Josiah still clinging to first place, and decided it was time for chaos. The result? Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze dropped 59 points like a nuclear bomb on the league, Don remembered what winning looks like, and the entire mid-table became a graveyard of broken dreams and shattered egos.

At the top, Peter **obliterated** Harry in a performance so dominant it should come with a parental warning and a therapist hotline. Don finally woke up from his season-long coma to slap down Andrew, Noah squeaked past Kyle in the kind of nail-biter that makes people question if their heart medication is up to date, and Josiah beat Sean to maintain his fraudulent grip on first place. Meanwhile, Ron **finally** remembered he's capable of winning by beating Chris, and Zryan somehow managed to beat Roy, which is less impressive than it sounds because Roy's team is about as threatening as a participation trophy convention.

The standings are a beautiful disaster: Josiah's at the top with 15 wins but everyone knows he's been exposed. Sean and Peter are tied at 13 wins each, snapping at his heels like hungry wolves. The mid-table is a cosmic joke where everyone's between 9-12 wins and nobody knows who's actually good. And at the bottom? Harry's still there, drowning in mediocrity with a goal difference so catastrophic it looks like a war crime.

Week 23 made one thing clear: Peter's here to collect scalps, Don's finally awake, and the rest of you are just extras in someone else's highlight reel.

## 🏆 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 59 pts

Peter, you absolute **MADMAN**. Fifty-nine points. **FIFTY-NINE**. You didn't just win this week — you **rewrote the laws of physics**, broke several international treaties, and made Harry question every life choice that led him to this moment. This wasn't a victory, this was a **public execution televised in 8K HDR** with Dolby Atmos surround sound so everyone could hear Harry's dignity dying in crystal-clear audio.

You beat Harry 59-36, which is the fantasy football equivalent of bringing a flamethrower to a pillow fight. Harry showed up with his usual collection of broken dreams and statistical anomalies, and you **atomized him** with the kind of efficiency that makes people wonder if you've been replaced by an AI that's been specifically programmed to destroy souls and collect prize money.

But let's not get carried away. You're still 13-10 now, sitting in third place like a **participation trophy that gained sentience** and decided it wanted more. You look like if **hepatitis C was a person** — like a walking medical warning that makes people instinctively reach for hand sanitizer when you walk by. "Peattle Pounders"? The only thing you're pounding is the waiver wire at 3 AM like a desperate man refreshing his ex's Instagram story.

Your season's been a rollercoaster of mediocrity punctuated by moments of accidental competence. You started 3-8, which was so catastrophic it looked like performance art. Now you're clawing your way back like a **zombie climbing out of its grave** — technically alive, deeply unsettling, and nobody's quite sure how to process what they're seeing. You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a questionable makeover at a community college cosmetology program.

Still, fifty-nine points is fifty-nine points. You're $11 richer and everyone else is $1 poorer because you decided to actually try this week. Frame this gameweek, tattoo it across your chest, because moments like this are rarer than your team looking competent two weeks in a row. Enjoy the throne while it lasts, because next week you'll probably score 22 points and remind everyone why you spent half the season in the basement.

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 57 pts

Don, you **WOKE UP**. Fifty-seven points and you beat Andrew 57-39 in a performance so clean it made people question if you've been body-snatched by someone who actually knows how to play fantasy football. This wasn't just a win — this was a **statement**, a **declaration of intent**, a **manifesto written in Andrew's tears**.

You look like **Fat Damon** — like someone took a perfectly good actor, put him through a deep fryer, and then sent him to therapy where he learned nothing. But this week? This week you were **Good Damon**, the version that actually shows up to set prepared instead of eating craft services and complaining about the script. Fifty-seven points is the kind of score that makes people respect you, even if they don't want to admit it.

"son4lyfe"? More like **second4mostofthisseason**, but not this week. This week you were a football god, a fantasy wizard, a points-generating machine that made Andrew look like he was playing a different sport entirely. You beat him by 18 points, which is like **dunking on a six-foot rim** while wearing platform shoes and still making it look impressive because your opponent was trying to dunk on a two-foot rim and kept missing.

You're 10-13 now, sitting in ninth place, which is the perfect metaphor for your existence: not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be feared, just... there, floating in the league like a **cosmic anomaly** that nobody knows how to categorize. Your season's been one long participation award ceremony where you're both the presenter and the recipient, except you keep giving the award to yourself and everyone's too polite to say anything.

But this week? This week you were the **main character**. You had the second-highest score, you beat Andrew who's been pretending he's good all season, and you proved that even broken clocks are right twice a day — and when you're right, you're REALLY right. Enjoy it while it lasts, because next week you'll probably score 29 points and remember why you're 10-13 instead of competing for the title.

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 41 pts

Noah, you won by **ONE POINT**. Forty-one to forty. You beat Kyle 41-40 in a result so close it should come with a cardiac monitor, a defibrillator on standby, and a support group for people who've experienced near-death fantasy football experiences. This wasn't a victory — this was **survival**, a **narrow escape from certain death**, a **statistical hiccup** in the matrix that somehow worked in your favor.

You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go** — like someone took a perfectly good pop star and ran him through a discount blender set to "questionable life choices and too many late-night burritos." You're 12-11 now, sitting in sixth place with a record that screams "I'm mediocre and I've accepted it as my identity." You have a face so forgettable that people have to check the roster three times to remember you're in this league.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, the only trophy you're winning is **Most Likely to Win by One Point and Still Find a Way to Make It Unimpressive**. You beat Kyle by literally the smallest margin possible, which is like winning a race because your opponent tripped over their own shoelaces at the finish line. It's technically a W, but everyone watching knows it was pure luck wrapped in coincidence and blessed by whatever deity manages statistical anomalies.

Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison. You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you in a way that makes people uncomfortable but they can't quite articulate why. Every week you manage to scrape together just enough points to avoid complete embarrassment, and this week you scraped together exactly one more point than Kyle, which is the most Noah thing that's ever happened.

Still, a W's a W. You're 12-11, somehow still relevant, somehow still in the playoff conversation, somehow still making people question how you've won 12 games when your team looks like it was assembled by someone who's never watched football and gets all their sports knowledge from Yahoo Answers circa 2007.

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 40 pts

Kyle, you lost by **ONE POINT**. Forty points and you lost to Noah 40-41 in a result so heartbreaking it should come with a grief counselor, a support group, and a hotline for people who've experienced fantasy football trauma that might require professional intervention. This wasn't just a loss — this was **tragedy in its purest form**, a **statistical middle finger from the universe**, a reminder that even when you do everything right, the cosmos will still find a way to ruin your day.

"Extended Foreplay"? More like **Extended Blueballs**, because you spent all week building up to something great and then got denied at the last possible second by Noah, who looks like he manages his team while simultaneously napping and forgetting he has a team. You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height and added it to his waistline** — like someone ordered a warrior from Wish.com and got the clearance bin version that comes with a dad bod and performance anxiety.

You're 9-14 now, sitting in tenth place with a record so bad it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If I Tried Really Hard But The Universe Hated Me Specifically*. You scored forty points — that's GOOD! That's a respectable score! But Noah scored forty-one, which means you're going home with an L and a broken spirit instead of a W and dignity.

Your season is a perfect metaphor for your team name: it's all buildup with no payoff, all promise with no delivery, all **"this might finally be my week"** followed immediately by **"why do I even bother with this stupid league"**. You look like **Otis from Sex Education** — technically the main character of your own story, but everyone watching knows you're really just the awkward side character who exists to make other people look better by comparison.

You lost by one point. ONE. POINT. That's the kind of loss that haunts you, that keeps you awake at 3 AM questioning every decision you made all season. That's the kind of loss that makes you refresh the scores seventeen times hoping there was a stat correction. That's the kind of loss that makes you the punchline in next week's summary when someone needs an example of cosmic injustice. Better luck next week, Kyle. You're gonna need it.

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 39 pts

Andrew, you got **bodied**. Thirty-nine points and you lost to Don 39-57 in a performance so disappointing it should come with a formal apology, a written explanation, and a promise to do better that we all know you won't keep. You're the league's **eternal bridesmaid**, the guy who's always *almost* good but never quite there, the **human equivalent of a participation trophy** that gained sentience and decided mediocrity was its calling.

You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star and put him through a dehydrator, leaving behind a husk that vaguely resembles what used to be cool but is now just... there. You're 12-11 now, sitting in fourth place, which would be impressive if it weren't for the fact that you're tied with three other managers who are all equally mediocre and nobody can figure out who's actually good.

"Cunha Get Me Points"? Bro, Cunha would probably file a **restraining order** if he knew you existed. You lost to Don by 18 points — DON! The guy who's been sleepwalking through this season like a zombie at a meditation retreat! The guy who looks like **Fat Damon** and plays fantasy football like **Bad Damon**! And he **demolished** you with the kind of efficiency that makes people question if you've actually been trying all season or if you've just been coasting on name recognition and past glory.

Your squad looks sharp on paper, but paper doesn't win games. You've got balance, you've got depth, but what you don't have is **killer instinct**, that murderous edge that separates contenders from pretenders. You're the guy who brings expensive wine to the party but still gets outshone by someone who brought a six-pack of PBR and a good attitude. You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant when everyone knows you peaked three years ago.

You're 12-11 with a +67 goal difference, which means you score points but also hemorrhage them like a broken fire hydrant in summer. You're proving that being consistently inconsistent is your only consistent trait. Enjoy your loss to Don, Andrew. It's a perfect reminder that even when you think you're safe, someone will always be there to humble you spectacularly.

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 38 pts

Josiah, you won, but nobody cares. Thirty-eight points and you beat Sean 38-29 in a performance so unimpressive it barely registers as a victory. You're like someone who won a race because everyone else fell down — technically correct, deeply unsatisfying, and everyone knows you didn't earn it.

You're 15-8 now, still sitting in first place, still clinging to your fraudulent empire like a dictator who knows the revolution is coming but refuses to accept it. You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you in a way that makes people instinctively cross the street when they see you coming. You don't *win* games, you *outlast* people like a **cockroach outlasts a nuclear apocalypse** — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow thriving in disaster while everyone wishes you'd just disappear already.

"thenotsospecialone"? You got that right. You're not special. You're a **statistical anomaly**, a **fraud propped up by luck** and favorable fixtures. Your +59 goal difference is the only thing keeping people from completely exposing you, but everyone knows the truth: you're a paper champion, an empty throne, a **participation trophy** that somehow ended up on the top shelf where it doesn't belong.

You beat Sean with 38 points, which is like beating a **wounded animal** that's already given up on life. Sean scored 29 — TWENTY-NINE! — and you only managed 38, which means you're barely functional yourself. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people hold their breath when you walk by, like you're a walking biohazard that escaped from a food court dumpster fire.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're the best when everyone knows you're just the luckiest. You're 15-8, but Sean's right behind you at 13-10, Peter's at 13-10, and the wolves are circling. Your fraudulent empire is crumbling, and when it falls, the schadenfreude will be **LEGENDARY**.

Enjoy first place while you can, Josiah. The revolution is coming, and you're the first one going to the guillotine.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 37 pts

Ron, you won. Thirty-seven points and you beat Chris 37-22 in a battle of who's less terrible, and somehow you emerged victorious. This is like watching two snails race and celebrating because one of them finished before the heat death of the universe. You're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits**, but this week you were slightly less mossy than usual.

You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you in a way that makes people uncomfortable but they're too polite to mention it directly. "Atlético SeaSlug" is still the most accurate team name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards.

You're 12-11 now, sitting in fifth place with a +102 goal difference, which is the only impressive thing about you. But let's be real: you beat CHRIS. Chris, who scored 22 points. **TWENTY-TWO**. Your grandmother could score more points than that, and she's been dead for six years and never watched football in her life. You beat the easiest opponent possible by 15 points, and somehow you're supposed to feel accomplished?

Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug at a retirement home. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you. Your defense oscillates between "mildly competent" and "furniture from IKEA that nobody knows how to assemble." Watching your team is like watching a snail in rush hour: slow, vulnerable, guaranteed to get crushed by something bigger, and leaving a disgusting trail that nobody wants to clean up.

You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets confused and starts collecting DNA samples in its mouth for reasons nobody wants to understand.

Still, a W's a W. You're 12-11, somehow still relevant, somehow still in the playoff mix, somehow still making people question how you've won 12 games when your team looks like it was assembled during a power outage by someone who's never heard of football. **Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 12-11, barely relevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be great at this. 🐌**

---

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 36 pts

Harry, you got **annihilated**. Thirty-six points and you lost to Peter 36-59 in a performance so catastrophic it should be preserved in the Louvre under the title *Portrait of a Man Who Gave Up Halfway Through*. This wasn't just a loss — this was a **public execution**, a **snuff film**, a **war crime disguised as fantasy football**.

You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar** and then ate the entire jar, the cookies, the kitchen counter, and still looked hungry for more disappointment. You're 7-16 now — SEVEN AND SIXTEEN! — sitting in dead last with a goal difference of -163, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was My Entire Personality and I Leaned Into It*.

You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement. Your team name is "cunha believe it," and every week the rest of us keep answering: no, we really can't believe you're still this bad. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming Palmer and Šeško for not scoring enough while refusing to acknowledge that your team management skills are about as effective as a screen door on a submarine.

Peter beat you by 23 points — TWENTY-THREE! — in a performance so dominant it made you look like a toddler playing chess against a grandmaster. You didn't just lose, you **disappeared**, you **evaporated**, you became a **cautionary tale** that parents tell their children about what happens when you don't try hard enough in life.

You're 7-16 with two draws somehow mixed in there, which means at some point this season you were so bad you couldn't even lose properly. You scored 36 points, which is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock, let my cat pick my team, and the cat dies halfway through the process and I just submit whatever random players it stepped on**.

You're the league's designated punching bag, the free win on everyone's schedule, the manager people circle on their calendar and thank the fantasy football gods for blessing them with an easy three points. You're not a competitor — you're a **community service project for managers who need to feel better about themselves**. Enjoy the basement, Harry. You've made it your home, decorated it with your tears, and apparently decided to stay there permanently.

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 35 pts

Zryan, you beat Roy. Thirty-five points and you beat Roy 35-27 in a result that's less impressive than it sounds because Roy's team is about as threatening as a **wet napkin at a steel girder convention**. You're 9-14 now, sitting in eleventh place, which means you've somehow won nine games this season despite looking like you manage your team while simultaneously experiencing a stroke and forgetting what sport this is.

You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used cooking oil instead of adamantium, leaving you with a sheen that makes people instinctively reach for paper towels when you walk by. "FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation, degradation, and being the league's designated disaster**.

Your -175 goal difference is so catastrophic it looks like a nuclear blast zone. You've scored 789 points this season, which sounds impressive until you realize you've **allowed 964 points**, which means your defense is about as effective as a chain-link fence made of tissue paper. Every week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine, your dignity, and whatever's left of your self-respect.

But this week? This week you beat ROY. Roy, who's supposed to be good. Roy, who started the season 8-2 and strutting around like he owned the place. You beat him with 35 points — which is still terrible, by the way — because Roy's team is currently in freefall like a plane that's run out of fuel, ideas, and the will to live.

You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic crime scene that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets confused, panics, and accidentally creates sentient disappointment.

Enjoy your win over Roy, Zryan. It's probably the only time this season you'll beat someone who was actually supposed to be good, and even then, everyone knows Roy's just as much of a disaster as you are right now.

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 29 pts

Sean, twenty-nine points. **TWENTY-NINE**. You lost to Josiah 29-38 in a performance so bad it makes people question if you've been replaced by a malfunctioning AI that's been programmed specifically to disappoint everyone who believed in you. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you in a way that makes children cry and adults uncomfortable.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the noise a **cartoon pigeon makes when it flies into a window** — and that's you every single week. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. You're 13-10 now, sitting in second place by some statistical miracle, and everyone knows it's only a matter of time before you crash back down to earth like a meteor made entirely of broken dreams and wasted potential.

You scored 29 points in 2026, in the year of our Lord Fantasy Premier League, when scoring is easier than it's ever been and even the worst teams can stumble into 35 points by accident. You managed 29, which is the fantasy football equivalent of showing up to a potluck with nothing and then eating everyone else's food while complaining that the mac and cheese is too cheesy.

You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes ancestry researchers question their career choices. Your season has been a rollercoaster of inconsistency where one week you're a football god and the next you're scoring 29 points against JOSIAH, who's been exposed as a fraud more times than a carnival psychic.

You lost to Josiah with 29 points. You let the **fraud king** beat you. You let the **participation trophy champion** collect three points off your corpse. That's not just embarrassing — that's a **career-defining moment of failure** that people will bring up at your funeral as evidence that you never reached your potential.

You're 13-10, somehow tied for second place, somehow still in the title race, somehow still making people question if you're actually good or if you've just been lucky for 23 weeks straight. Enjoy second place while it lasts, Sean, because next week you'll probably score 51 points and remember you're capable of competence before immediately forgetting again the week after.

---

## ⚰️ Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 27 pts

Roy. **ROY**. Twenty-seven points. You lost to ZRYAN 27-35 in a result so embarrassing it should come with a formal apology to football, fantasy sports, and everyone who's ever believed in you. This wasn't just a loss — this was **character assassination**, a **public execution of your reputation**, a **moment that defines your entire season as fraudulent**.

You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind a chunky, questionable version that makes people wonder if they should call the police or a priest. "This Year FC"? Bro, it's **NEVER your year**. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke that everyone saw coming except you.

You started the season 8-2, remember? Eight and two. You were strutting around like you owned the place, chest out, chin high, whispering "maybe this year is mine" while everyone else rolled their eyes and waited for the collapse. And boy, did you collapse. You're now 12-11, sitting in seventh place with a **negative goal difference** of -57, which means you've been hemorrhaging points like a broken dam for weeks.

You lost to Zryan. **ZRYAN**. The guy who's 9-14. The guy with a -175 goal difference. The guy who looks like **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin** and manages his team like he's simultaneously experiencing a stroke and trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. And he **BEAT YOU** with 35 points while you managed 27.

Twenty-seven points is what I score when I **forget fantasy football exists, go on vacation, come back three weeks later, and check my team just to see how bad the damage is**. You scored 27 points while actually trying, which is somehow worse than if you'd just given up and gone to therapy instead.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant when everyone knows your 15 minutes of fame expired around Week 12. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of excuses, blame-shifting, and diagrams showing how the universe is specifically conspiring against you.

We are gathered here today to mourn the death of Roy's season. Born with hope in Week 1, peaked at Week 11, died a slow, painful death starting Week 12. Cause of death: exposure as a fraud. He leaves behind a hollow 12-11 record, a negative goal difference, and a reputation in ruins. May he rest in peace, because his season sure as hell won't.

**Amen. ⚰️🪦**

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 22 pts

Chris, **TWENTY-TWO POINTS**. You lost to Ron 22-37 in a performance so catastrophically bad it should be studied by scientists as proof that human incompetence has no theoretical limit. This wasn't just a loss — this was **a crime against fantasy football**, an **assault on the concept of trying**, a **masterclass in how to disappoint everyone who's ever believed in you**.

You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally wrong with you in a way that makes people uncomfortable. "Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over — and this week, they didn't exist, they never existed, and they filed a restraining order against you for claiming they're associated with your team.

You're 11-12 now, sitting in eighth place, which is the perfect metaphor for your entire existence: not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... there, floating in the middle of the league like a **turd in a punch bowl** that nobody wants to acknowledge but everyone knows is ruining the party.

You scored **twenty-two points** in a week where even the worst teams scored in the low 30s. You got outscored by everyone except Sean, who at least has the excuse of being consistently inconsistent. You have no excuse. You're just bad. You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient, leaving you with an expression that makes people question their life choices just from being in the same room as you.

You lost to RON. **RON!** The slug! The slime trail! The guy who looks like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley** and plays fantasy football like he's simultaneously trying to lose and accidentally winning sometimes! And he beat you by 15 points while barely trying!

You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**. You speak in theories, cite statistics, use big words, but your team performs like it's running PowerPoint slides from 2003 instead of plays. You look like you must have been an **auctioneer in your past life and so you've spent this lifetime repenting for it** — like someone who talks too fast, makes no sense, and makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a malfunctioning chatbot that gained sentience and decided mediocrity was its calling.

Enjoy your 22 points, Chris. That's fewer points than weeks in a season. That's fewer points than brain cells you lost reading this paragraph. That's fewer points than the number of people who believe you're actually good at this. You're 11-12, completely irrelevant, and the only thing more predictable than your mediocrity is your excuses for why it's not your fault.

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW23

GW23 was a **massacre disguised as fantasy football**. Peter dropped 59 points like a nuclear bomb and made Harry question every life choice that led him to fantasy sports. Don woke up from his season-long coma to slap down Andrew with 57 points of pure dominance. Noah squeaked past Kyle by literally one point in the kind of nail-biter that causes cardiac events. Josiah maintained his fraudulent grip on first place by beating Sean, who scored an embarrassing 29 points. Ron finally remembered he's capable of winning by beating Chris, who scored an even more embarrassing 22 points. And Zryan somehow beat Roy, which is less impressive than it sounds because Roy's in complete freefall.

The standings are a beautiful disaster: Josiah's at 15-8, still on top but everyone knows he's a fraud. Sean and Peter are tied at 13-10, breathing down his neck like wolves that smell blood. The mid-table is chaos where everyone's 9-12 wins and nobody knows who's actually good. And at the bottom? Harry's at 7-16 with a -163 goal difference, which is so bad it violates several international treaties.

**Top 3:** Peter (59) remembered he's capable of greatness and collected $11 from everyone else, Don (57) finally woke up and destroyed Andrew, and Noah (41) won by one point because the universe decided to bless him for once.

**Bottom 3:** Chris (22) should be investigated for crimes against fantasy football, Roy (27) lost to Zryan and needs to schedule an emergency therapy session, and Sean (29) let Josiah beat him and should be ashamed.

Week 23 made one thing clear: Peter's here to collect scalps, the standings are complete chaos, and if you're not scared yet, you should be. Because the playoffs are coming, and half of you aren't ready.

**See you next week for another round of carnage. 💀**
