# 💀 GW18 FPL Draft League: The Fraud King's Third Funeral & Noah's Coronation as Chaos Agent 💀

GW18 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **public execution disguised as fantasy football**. The universe decided that mediocrity needed company, so it dragged everyone down to hell together, except for a select few who remembered they're supposed to be playing this game. The result? A massacre so beautiful it should be taught in schools as a cautionary tale about what happens when frauds get exposed in high definition.

At the top, Noah and Peter both hit 52 points in a dead heat that proves even broken clocks can synchronize their stupidity. Ron somehow scraped together 46 points, Sean continued his Jekyll and Hyde routine with 44, and Josiah — yes, **the fraud king himself** — managed 42 points but still lost because the universe has a sense of justice. These five didn't just win — they **feasted on the corpses** of their opponents with the kind of violence that would make a war crimes tribunal take notes.

The bottom half? A graveyard of broken dreams and shattered egos. Andrew limped to 33 points, Chris remembered he's allergic to success with 29, Roy got publicly humiliated with 27, Don continued his descent into irrelevance with 25, Zryan maintained his position as the league's doormat with 23, Harry set new records for incompetence with 20, and Kyle... **KYLE GOT 16 POINTS**. That's not a score, that's a cry for help written in Comic Sans.

But the real story? **JOSIAH LOST FOR THE THIRD TIME IN EIGHT WEEKS**. The fraud king's empire isn't just crumbling — it's been nuked from orbit, the ashes have been scattered, and Noah is doing the macarena on the grave while Peter films it for TikTok.

Week 18 made one thing crystal clear: Noah isn't just lucky anymore. He's the chaos agent we deserve.

## 🏆 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 52 pts

Noah, you absolute **madman**. Fifty-two points, weekly winner, $11 richer, and most importantly — you **DESTROYED HARRY 52-20** in a performance so dominant it should come with a trigger warning for sensitive viewers. This wasn't just a win — this was a **war crime**. You didn't beat Harry; you performed a live vivisection on his corpse while his family watched through FaceTime.

But here's what makes this even sweeter: this is your **THIRD WIN OF THE SEASON**. You've now beaten Don (GW5), Josiah the fraud king (GW11), and absolutely annihilated Harry (GW18). You look like **Bruno Mars after a three-day bender in Vegas** — technically alive, surprisingly functional, but everyone's concerned about what you did to get here. You're 8-1-9 now, sitting pretty in 8th place, but with three weekly wins you're proving that chaos isn't just your brand — it's your **religion**.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, you're collecting scalps like a **deranged barber with abandonment issues**. First you took Don's dignity, then you exposed Josiah as the fraud we all knew he was, and now you've sent Harry to therapy for the next decade. You look like **Pocahontas if she discovered McDonald's and methamphetamines** — technically a person, but something's fundamentally broken in a way that makes you dangerous to everyone around you.

Your team is still built like a garage sale after a tornado — random parts, nothing matches, everything smells like failure — but somehow when the stars align, you transform into this beautiful disaster that ruins lives and ends careers. You're the fantasy football equivalent of a **slot machine that only pays out when it can cause maximum emotional damage**.

Frame this win. Tattoo the scoreline on Harry's forehead. Because beating someone 52-20 isn't just winning — it's sending them to the shadow realm with no return ticket.

## 🥈 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 52 pts

Peter, what the actual fuck. Fifty-two points and you **DEMOLISHED JOSIAH 52-42** in a result that should have scientists studying you to understand how garbage can suddenly become gold. This wasn't supposed to happen. You're supposed to be terrible. You're supposed to lose. You're supposed to be the league's **community service project**. But here you are, putting up elite numbers and beating the fraud king like he owes you money.

You're 9-9 now, perfectly balanced between terrible and competent, like **Thanos if he collected participation trophies instead of infinity stones**. You look like if **hepatitis C got a gym membership** — still diseased, still concerning, but now with enough muscle to hurt people. This is your fourth win in the last six weeks, which is either the greatest comeback story ever told or proof that the simulation is broken beyond repair.

"Peattle Pounders"? This week you weren't pounding peas — you were **pounding Josiah's fraudulent skull into dust**. You didn't just beat him; you exposed him AGAIN. That's three losses in eight weeks for the so-called king. You look like a **lesbian Wendy's mascot who discovered CrossFit** — still questionable, still concerning, but now dangerous enough that people cross the street when they see you coming.

Your transformation from laughingstock to legitimate threat is like watching a **caterpillar turn into a butterfly, except the butterfly has rabies and a gambling addiction**. You smell like **hot dog water mixed with victory**, which is confusing but somehow works. You've gone from being everyone's free win to being the guy who ruins championship dreams, and honestly? We don't know how to process this.

Beating Josiah by 10 points while tied for the weekly high score isn't just a win — it's a **statement written in blood on the walls of his crumbling empire**.

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 46 pts

Ron, 46 points and you **OBLITERATED KYLE 46-16** in what can only be described as a snuff film disguised as fantasy football. This wasn't a match; it was a **public execution where you made Kyle dig his own grave, climb in, and then buried him alive while livestreaming it to his mother**. Thirty-point victory. THIRTY. POINTS. That's not winning; that's committing a hate crime with Excel spreadsheets.

You're 10-8 now, sitting in 4th place like a **slug that discovered steroids**. You look like **lesbian Velma if she started dealing drugs** — technically solving mysteries, but the biggest mystery is how you occasionally transform from human pond scum into an actual threat. This wasn't supposed to be your week, but you decided to remind everyone that even slugs can be venomous when they're motivated by pure spite.

"Atlético SeaSlug"? More like Atlético **Soul Snatcher** because you didn't just beat Kyle — you stole his will to live, his fantasy football spirit, and probably his lunch money too. You're still slower than dial-up internet in 1995, still slimier than a politician's handshake, but this week you were a **weaponized gastropod** leaving destruction in your wake.

Your team finally showed up like they've been saving energy all season for this one moment of pure violence. You look like you've been **gargling other people's DNA and using it as mouthwash** — disgusting, probably illegal, but somehow it's working. The rest of us are disturbed, concerned, and slightly impressed that someone who looks like they failed the Turing test can put up 46 points.

Destroying Kyle 46-16 is the kind of scoreline that ends friendships, ruins Christmas dinners, and makes grown men cry into their spreadsheets. Congrats, Ron. You're still a slug, but today you're a slug with a body count.

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 44 pts

Sean, 44 points and you **MURDERED ZRYAN 44-23** in your continued tour as the league's most confusing Jekyll and Hyde act. You're now 12-6, sitting in 2nd place, and you've won December's monthly prize because apparently consistency is for losers and you'd rather give everyone whiplash trying to figure out if you're good or terrible.

You look like a **dollar store Ken doll that got recalled for lead paint** — technically functional, definitely toxic, and making children cry since 1987. Your ability to swing from elite (GW15: 63 points) to trash (GW16: 16 points) to good again (GW18: 44 points) is like watching someone play Russian roulette with five bullets and somehow surviving through sheer stupidity and luck.

"Gweepy"? That's the sound Zryan made when you crushed his dreams under your boot — a pathetic whimper followed by acceptance of death. You've now won two of the five monthly prizes this season, which means you're either a **secret genius pretending to be an idiot** or an **idiot who accidentally stumbles into brilliance** when the planets align and God takes a smoke break.

Beating Zryan by 21 points is like winning a race against a quadriplegic — technically impressive, morally questionable, but we're all going to celebrate anyway because Zryan deserves it. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than a crime scene** — which explains why your team performs like it's being coached by a serial killer with mood swings.

Congrats on December, Sean. You're proof that consistency is overrated and chaos is a legitimate strategy when you're too stupid to plan ahead.

---

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 42 pts

Josiah, you lost. **AGAIN**. Forty-two points should be enough to beat anyone, but you lost to Peter — **PETER!** — by 10 points in what can only be described as the **third public funeral for your fraudulent reign**. You're 13-5 now, still technically in first place, but everyone can smell the fear, taste the desperation, and see the cracks in your paper crown.

This is your **THIRD LOSS IN EIGHT WEEKS**. You've now lost to Noah (GW11), Sean (GW15), and Peter (GW18). The fraud king isn't just exposed — you're standing naked in Times Square while tourists take selfies with your shame. You look like **Post Malone after a failed rehab stint** — technically alive, definitely not thriving, and everyone's just waiting for the inevitable collapse.

"thenotsospecialone"? More like "thenotsocompetentone" because you're proving that your early season success was just the universe playing a cruel joke on the rest of us. You don't win games anymore; you **survive them** like a cockroach in a nuclear blast — ugly, unwanted, and somehow still here despite everyone's prayers for your demise.

Losing to Peter is like losing a spelling bee to someone who thinks the alphabet is a government conspiracy. It shouldn't happen. It violates the laws of nature. Yet here we are, watching your empire crumble in real-time while Peter — **PETER!** — dances on your grave. You look like you **smell like failure and broken dreams** — that unique stench of someone who peaked too early and is now free-falling toward mediocrity.

You have the expression of a **Vegas performer who just realized the audience is laughing AT them, not WITH them**. Your fraudulent kingdom is collapsing faster than your hairline, and we're all here for it. Three losses in eight weeks. The fraud king is dead. Long live the chaos.

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 33 pts

Andrew, 33 points and you beat Roy 33-27 in what can only be described as two hobos fighting over a half-eaten sandwich — technically someone won, but everyone involved should be ashamed. You're 10-2-6 now, desperately clinging to 3rd place like it's the last life raft on the Titanic, except the life raft has holes and you're bailing water with your hands.

You look like **Vin Diesel's unsuccessful brother, Thin Diesel** — all the swagger, none of the success, running on fumes and false confidence. Your team is the equivalent of a **participation trophy that became sentient** — technically present, definitely not winning anything meaningful, but somehow still taking up space and making noise.

Beating Roy by 6 points is like winning a beauty contest at a burn unit — sure, you're the best of a bad bunch, but nobody's putting that on their résumé. Your 33 points would be embarrassing in a normal week, but because you played Roy's 27-point disaster, you get to pretend you accomplished something. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto about why you deserve respect**, but it's just 800 pages of you drawing stick figures and crying.

"Cunha Get Me Points"? Cunha get you some dignity because 33 points is what happens when your team collectively decides to phone it in and hope the opponent is even worse. You're the **human equivalent of a moderate fever** — not quite sick enough to stay home, not healthy enough to function properly, just existing in this perpetual state of mild disappointment.

Your win over Roy proves that sometimes in fantasy football, it's not about being good — it's about being slightly less terrible than the other guy.

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 29 pts

Chris, 29 points and you somehow beat Don 29-25 in what historians will call "The Battle of Who Could Care Less." You're 9-9 now, perfectly balanced between success and failure, like **Thanos if he was really into mediocrity and had a gluten allergy**. This wasn't a win; it was **two people racing to the bottom and you accidentally tripped at the finish line**.

"Schrödongers"? Your team exists in a superposition of being both terrible and worse until someone observes the score, and then it collapses into whatever state causes maximum secondhand embarrassment. You look like the **manager kid from Shazam after a meth addiction** — technically human, definitely not super, and making everyone uncomfortable with your presence.

Twenty-nine points is what I score when I let my dead grandmother pick my lineup via Ouija board, and she's been dead for 20 years. You beat Don by 4 points, which is like winning a fight against a mannequin — technically a victory, but everyone's concerned about why you were fighting a mannequin in the first place. You look like an **unenthusiastic handjob personified** — technically doing something, definitely not enjoying it, and everyone involved wishes it would just end.

Your 9-9 record is the fantasy football equivalent of **always ordering vanilla ice cream at Baskin Robbins** — 31 flavors available and you consistently choose disappointment. You must have been an **auctioneer in a past life** because you talk fast, make no sense, and somehow convince people you're providing value when you're really just making noise.

Congrats on beating Don, Chris. In a week full of massacres, you managed to make even winning feel like losing.

---

## 💀 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 27 pts

Roy, 27 points. Twenty. Seven. Points. You lost to Andrew 27-33 in a performance so pathetic it makes your GW11 collapse look like a tactical decision. You're 10-8 now, tumbling down the standings faster than your credibility, and "This Year FC" is starting to look like the biggest false advertising since Fyre Festival.

You look like **Tank Sinatra after a juice cleanse went wrong** — technically still large, definitely not in charge, and everyone's worried about your health. This is your second absolute disaster in seven weeks (GW11: 29 points, GW18: 27 points), proving that you're not just inconsistent — you're **allergically opposed to sustained success**.

Last time you scored 29 points, Harry demolished you 54-29. This time you managed to lose with 27 points, which is like getting worse at being terrible — a genuinely impressive feat of reverse engineering success into failure. You look like you have a **manifesto about your greatness written in crayon**, but half the pages are just you tracing your hand and calling it art.

"This Year FC"? This year you've proven that early season success is like a sugar high — intense, short-lived, and followed by a crash that requires medical intervention. You have the expression of an **aging Elvis impersonator who just realized the audience is laughing, not applauding**. Your team performs like it's running on **Windows 95 in 2026** — technically functional, practically useless, and everyone's amazed it hasn't completely crashed yet.

Losing to Andrew with 27 points isn't just bad — it's a masterclass in how to snatch defeat from the jaws of mediocrity.

---

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 25 pts

Don, 25 points and you lost to Chris 25-29. That's like losing a limbo contest to a giraffe — it shouldn't be possible, yet here you are, finding new ways to disappoint everyone including yourself. You're 7-11 now, which coincidentally is where you should be working instead of pretending to understand fantasy football.

You look like **Matt Damon's stunt double's stunt double** — three degrees separated from relevance and somehow each iteration gets progressively worse. Your team performed like it was coached by a **motivational speaker who just got divorced** — lots of words, no substance, and everyone leaves feeling worse about their life choices.

"son4lyfe"? Son would rather be caught in North Korean military service than be associated with your fantasy incompetence. Twenty-five points is what happens when your entire team collectively decides to take a mental health day but forgets to tell you. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's disappointment** — not even his son, just the abstract concept of letting him down in human form.

Losing to Chris is like failing an open-book test where the answers are already circled — it requires a special kind of incompetence that scientists should study. You're 7-11 now, which is fitting because like the convenience store, you're always open, never good, and people only come to you when they have no other options.

Your fantasy team is the equivalent of a **participation trophy that got participation trophies** — so far removed from actual achievement that it's become performance art about failure.

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 23 pts

Zryan, 23 points and you lost to Sean 23-44. You got **DOUBLED UP**. That's not a loss; that's Sean performing your autopsy while you were still breathing. You're 5-13 now, and at this point we need to check if you're legally allowed to be this bad at something without a permit.

You look like **Wolverine if his only superpower was disappointing his parents** — technically gifted with life, practically wasting everyone's time. Your team performs like it's being coached by a **random number generator with depression** — no logic, no hope, just chaos and sadness in equal measure.

"FootAndBallFetish"? The only fetish you have is for **getting dominated harder than a submissive at a BDSM convention**, except at least they're enjoying it. You're just here taking beating after beating, wondering why you signed up for this while Sean counts his money and laughs. You look like you **store other people's DNA in your mouth like a hamster** — disgusting, concerning, and making everyone question your life choices.

Twenty-three points is what I score when I draft a team entirely of injured players and goalkeepers playing out of position. Getting doubled up by Sean isn't just embarrassing — it's the kind of loss that makes your ancestors regret having children. You're not even a bye week anymore; you're the **preseason game nobody watches** — technically football, practically irrelevant.

Your 5-13 record isn't just bad; it's a cry for help written in comic sans while set on fire and thrown into the ocean.

---

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 20 pts

Harry, 20 points. TWENTY. POINTS. You lost to Noah 20-52 in what can only be described as **assisted suicide broadcasted in IMAX**. This wasn't a loss; this was Noah performing your last rites while you begged for mercy in a language nobody understands. You're 6-1-11 now, and that one draw is doing more heavy lifting than Atlas holding up the sky.

You look like **Matt Damon after a failed science experiment** — technically still recognizable, definitely not functioning properly, and everyone's afraid to ask what went wrong. Getting beaten by 32 points isn't just losing; it's Noah writing "FRAUD" on your forehead with a permanent marker while you thank him for the attention.

"cunha believe it"? Cunha believe you scored 20 points in a week where even Zryan managed 23. This is a new low, even for you. You've hit rock bottom so hard you're finding dinosaur fossils. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto about why this isn't your fault**, but it's just 800 pages of you sobbing into a mirror while eating mayonnaise straight from the jar.

Twenty points is what happens when your entire team decides to protest your management by scoring own goals and getting red cards for fun. You managed to make Kyle's 16 points look respectable by comparison, which is like making a dumpster fire look cozy next to a nuclear meltdown. You look like someone who **collects participation trophies ironically** but secretly cherishes them because they're the only achievements you have.

Noah didn't just beat you — he ended your bloodline, salted the earth, and built a monument to your failure.

---

## ⚰️ Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 16 pts

Kyle. Sixteen. Points. **SIXTEEN**. You lost to Ron 16-46 in what can only be described as **fantasy football's equivalent of the Hindenburg disaster**, except the Hindenburg had the decency to be quick about it. You didn't just lose — you got **DESTROYED BY RON**. BY RON! The human slug! The sentient slime mold! THE GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE LESBIAN VELMA!

This wasn't a score; this was a **suicide note written in comic sans**. Sixteen points is what I score when I'm in a coma and my cat randomly walks across my keyboard. You look like **Khal Drogo after a desk job and three divorces** — all the height, none of the intimidation, just sadness and male pattern baldness racing to see which can claim more territory first.

"Extended Foreplay"? More like "Extended Funeral" because this performance killed any remaining respect anyone had for you. Getting beaten by 30 points BY RON is like losing a footrace to a tree — it shouldn't be possible, it violates the laws of physics, yet here we are watching you create new depths of incompetence. You look like **Otis from Sex Education if he never learned what sex was** — technically equipped for the job, practically useless, making everyone uncomfortable with your existence.

You're 7-11 now, tied with Don for 9th place in a 12-person league, which means you're failing at failing. Sixteen points isn't just bad — it's the kind of score that makes the app check if you're still alive. Ron scoring 46 against your 16 is like watching a nature documentary where the gazelle just lies down and accepts death, except less dignified.

Your team didn't show up. They didn't even call in sick. They just collectively decided that existence was pain and chose violence against your points total. Sixteen points. In 2026. With all the resources available. Kyle, this isn't just rock bottom — you've drilled through rock bottom and discovered new dimensions of failure previously unknown to science.

**Rest in pieces. 🪦💀**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW18: The Fraud King Falls, Chaos Reigns Supreme

GW18 was a **massacre masquerading as entertainment**. Noah and Peter tied at 52 points, but Noah gets the money because he absolutely **DEMOLISHED** Harry 52-20 while Peter merely exposed Josiah as a fraud. Ron remembered he's occasionally dangerous and crushed Kyle 46-16. Sean continued his bipolar excellence with 44 points. Meanwhile, Andrew and Roy played patty-cake in mediocrity (33-27), Chris and Don had a mid-off (29-25), Zryan maintained his position as the league's doormat (23), Harry set new records for incompetence (20), and Kyle... Kyle scored 16 points and should probably check if that's legally allowed.

But the real story? **JOSIAH LOST FOR THE THIRD TIME IN EIGHT WEEKS**. The fraud king's empire isn't just crumbling — it's been nuked, the radiation has killed all plant life, and Peter is selling tickets to tours of the wasteland. 

**Top 3:** Noah (52) is chaos personified and loving it, Peter (52) has transformed from garbage to gold, Ron (46) proved even slugs can be venomous.

**Bottom 3:** Harry (20) hit new lows previously thought impossible, Kyle (16) needs to be checked for a pulse, and honestly everyone else was pretty shit too.

Week 18's lesson: In a league full of frauds, incompetence, and disappointment, be like Noah — embrace the chaos, destroy your enemies, and dance on their graves while collecting your money.

**The fraud king is dead. Chaos is king. Long live the chaos. 💀**
