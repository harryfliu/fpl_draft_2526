### **Customizing League Settings**
Edit the initial values in `script.js`:
```javascript
let dashboardData = {
    leagueSize: 12,           // Number of teams
    prizePool: 420,           // Total prize pool ($35 × 12)
    currentGameweek: 1,       // Starting gameweek
    currentMonth: "August"    // Season start month
};
```

## 🚀 **Development Workflow**

### **Staging + Production Setup**
This project uses a professional development workflow:

- **`main`** → Production (stable, visible to managers)
- **`staging`** → Development (testing, only visible to you)
- **`feature/*`** → Individual features/changes

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Switch to staging branch for development
git checkout staging

# Test changes locally
python3 serve_dashboard.py

# Deploy to staging for testing
python3 deploy-github-clean.py

# Commit and push staging changes
git add . && git commit -m "Feature: [description]" && git push origin staging
```

### **Production Release**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge tested changes from staging
git merge staging

# Deploy to production
python3 deploy-github-clean.py

# Push to production
git add . && git commit -m "Release: [description]" && git push origin main
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Sync frequently**: Every significant change should be tested deployed
- **Test locally first**: Always verify locally before deployment
- **Keep staging updated**: Regular commits keep your development branch current
