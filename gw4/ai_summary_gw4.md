# 💀 GW4 FPL Draft League: False Kings, Paper Tigers, & Peter’s Payday 💀

Week 4 reminded everyone that this league is less about consistency and more about who can trip over a bag of points the loudest. Some of you strutted in thinking your unbeaten runs meant destiny was on your side—spoiler: destiny just ghosted you. Others managed to look competitive for the first time all season (hi Peter 👋), while the rest exposed themselves as frauds barely clinging to mid-table dignity.  

By the end of it, Josiah still refuses to lose, Peter cashed in on a technicality, and more than one manager should be googling “how to cope with mediocrity.”  

Let’s break it all down.  

---

## 🍻 Peter Henze – Peattle Pounders – 57 pts  
For three straight weeks, Peter was the league’s designated punching bag. GW1? Harry stuffed him into the dirt. GW2? Roy casually smacked him around. GW3? Chris reminded everyone Peter’s team name should be “Peattle Poundezed.” At 0–3, he wasn’t just in the basement — he was digging through the foundation looking for more L’s to collect.  

And then GW4 rolled in. Out of nowhere, Peter drops **57 points**, ties Josiah for top score, and snags the weekly pot on a **technicality**. It’s the equivalent of the uglier twin getting picked just because the bar lights were too dim. But hey, a win is a win, and after three weeks of being everyone’s chew toy, Peter finally got to taste what victory feels like.  

He’s still **1–3 overall**, sitting near the bottom, and one good week doesn’t erase the smell of those first three disasters. But for the first time all season, Peattle Pounders looked like they belonged in the league instead of in a charity tournament. Credit where it’s due: Peter finally put some respect on his name — now let’s see if he can actually keep it going, or if GW4 was just his one-night stand with competence.

## 💀 Josiah “thenotsospecialone” Loh – 57 pts  
Josiah, congrats on keeping your perfect record alive and hitting **57 points** this week. You’re sitting on top of the table at 4–0, but let’s be real: the shine’s already peeling off. Sure, you matched Peter for the week’s highest score, but you didn’t even get the prize money. Imagine dropping 57 and still losing the bag to *Peattle Pounders*. That’s like getting straight A’s and finding out your GPA still doesn’t qualify you for a scholarship because your school doesn’t count gym.  

Your season so far? It’s like watching a guy juggle chainsaws blindfolded. The results look impressive, but everyone knows the second variance blinks, you’re losing a hand. You’ve been scraping narrow wins since GW1, and this week just happened to be one of those rare moments where your team remembered how to play football.  

And let’s not forget: you’re still the league’s Venmo delinquent. Four weeks, four wins, **$4 unpaid**. Undefeated on the table, but bankrupt in the group chat. You’re like that friend who always “forgets his wallet” when the check comes — except now you’re flaunting your record while still owing people money.  

Here’s the cold truth: undefeated or not, nobody’s scared of *thenotsospecialone*. You’re riding high now, but when you finally eat that first L, it’s going to be a public execution.

## 💀 Sean “Gweepy” Dunn – 54 pts  
Sean, welcome to the top half of the scoreboard — a place you visit about as often as your squad visits the opposition box. You scraped together **54 points**, just enough to edge out Andrew in a 54–52 nailbiter. Congrats, you finally won a game without being a complete embarrassment.  

But don’t get comfortable. Let’s not forget GW1, when Josiah dropped you like a bad habit with 64 points. GW2, you scraped past Harry like a raccoon clawing at a garbage bin. GW3, you managed 20 points — twenty — and got stomped like a roach by Kyle. Now you’re suddenly acting like Gweepy’s on the rise? Please. This was less a statement win and more like watching a toddler finally learn to tie his shoes.  

Your team’s basically a slot machine: sometimes the numbers line up, most of the time it’s just a lot of flashing lights and wasted coins. And this week? You pulled the lever and somehow hit a small payout. Don’t get cocky, Sean. You’re 2–2, but everyone remembers that GW3 disaster. You’ll always be one bad week away from being the league’s comedy relief.  

---

## 💀 Andrew “Cunha Get Me Points” Smith – 52 pts  
Andrew, **52 points** should feel like a win. Instead, it’s another L on your record thanks to Sean’s 54. Losing to Sean is bad enough, but losing when he only beats you by two points? That’s character assassination. You’re basically the league’s designated “almost guy” — close enough to talk trash in the middle of the match, but irrelevant by Monday morning.  

Let’s not pretend this is new, either. You’ve been mid-table material since GW1. Beat Don, lost to Josiah, and now back-to-back “respectable losses.” You’re like Newcastle in the Champions League: plenty of effort, but nobody’s scared because they know you’ll choke when it matters.  

And your squad? More style than substance. You’ve got the branding, the banter, and the name, but your results scream “training cones.” Being “Cunha Get Me Points” is cute until Cunha doesn’t actually get you points — then it’s just false advertising.  

Here’s the truth: you’re good enough to make every opponent sweat, but not good enough to actually finish the job. You’re basically the Tinder date that looks great on paper but flakes when it’s time to meet up.

## 💀 Harry “cunha believe it” Liu – 49 pts  
Harry, you dropped **49 points** this week and still got smacked by Josiah’s 57. That’s like scoring a touchdown and then realizing the other team already ran up 30 on you. You’re 2–2 now, but let’s not sugarcoat it — your entire season is a tug-of-war between “actually dangerous” and “tragic comedy.”  

GW1, you beat Peter — which, let’s be honest, is basically a bye week. GW2, you lost to Sean, which should be an automatic relegation clause. GW3, you eked out a one-point win over Zryan, making you the first manager in league history to celebrate beating a winless team like it was a Champions League final. And now GW4? Josiah handled you like a substitute teacher with a room full of kindergartners.  

Your name *cunha believe it* feels more like a cry for help every week. Because we *can’t* believe it. One week you look competent, the next you’re fumbling like a drunk quarterback. At this point, the only thing consistent about you is your inconsistency.

## 💀 Ronangel “Atlético SeaSlug” Rojas – 48 pts  
Ron, you finally picked up a win this week, dropping **48 points** on Noah. But let’s be clear: beating Noah is like flexing because you won an arm-wrestling match against a toddler. Nobody’s impressed, and nobody’s rewriting the power rankings because you managed to put down the league’s quietest NPC.  

You’re sitting at **2–2**, and your résumé is basically “beat Noah and Zryan, lose to literally anyone with a pulse.” That’s not a record, that’s a cry for help. Your two wins are against managers who might as well be bots auto-submitting lineups. The second you run into someone competent, you fold faster than a folding chair at a pro wrestling match.  

Your squad? Still a disaster. Gyökeres, Raúl, and Füllkrug aren’t a front line, they’re a German-language punchline. Your midfield is a cast of benchwarmers, and your defense is out here cosplaying as prime Maldini one week and traffic cones the next. You don’t manage this team, you babysit it and pray it doesn’t choke on Legos.  

Atlético SeaSlug is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you. This week was no exception — you just slimed past Noah, who’s so irrelevant half the league forgets he’s even here. Congrats on the W, Ron, but it’s fool’s gold. The moment you’re matched up against someone above the NPC tier, you’ll be right back where you belong: crawling in the dirt. 🐌

## 💀 Kyle “Extended Foreplay” Herrera – 45 pts  
Kyle, you scored **45 points** this week and beat Don, which is basically the fantasy football equivalent of turning in your homework on time — the bar was so low it was underground. Don is chaos in human form, so congrats, you just outlasted a guy setting his squad on fire every other week. Nobody’s handing you a medal for that.  

You’re now **3–1**, and the record looks shiny, but let’s check the receipts: you’ve beaten Sean’s 20-point disaster, Don’s butter-churn of a team, and scraped by with mid-level point totals. That’s not dominance, that’s survival. “Extended Foreplay” is the perfect name, because your season has been nothing but tease — never delivering anything close to a finish.  

Your squad is as uninspiring as your wins. Points don’t come from strategy; they come from your opponents tripping over themselves. It’s like winning Mario Kart because everyone else drove off Rainbow Road. Sure, you’re in the top half now, but the second you face an actual contender, you’ll fold faster than a beach chair.  

Enjoy the 3–1 while you can, Kyle. Right now you’re just the league’s middle manager: above the worst, below the best, and destined to be forgotten.

## 💀 Don “son4lyfe” Kim – 38 pts  
Don, you scored **38 points** this week and lost to Kyle. That’s basically the universe restoring order. You had your cute little win last week against Ron, but GW4 reminded everyone that your team is the football equivalent of expired milk: sour, sad, and definitely not safe for consumption.  

You’re 1–3 now, and your lone victory came against the human slug himself. That’s like bragging about finishing a marathon when you actually just walked to the fridge. Nobody’s impressed, and nobody’s scared of you.  

Your transfer activity still looks like chaos theory in action — random moves, zero strategy, and all the cohesion of a middle school dodgeball draft. And Son? The guy your team name is literally built on? He’d rather fake an injury than log minutes in this dumpster fire of a squad. You’re living off his branding while delivering Watford-level results.  

Face it: your season peaked last week. Now you’re back to your natural habitat — the bottom half of the table, where you’ll be spending the rest of the year.  

---

## 💀 Noah “Trophies Matter FC” Wilson – 34 pts  
Noah, you managed **34 points** this week, which is cute if you’re in a 6-team beginner league. Unfortunately, you’re here with the adults, and you’re 1–3 with the résumé of a guy who should be relegated to MLS Fantasy.  

Your one win? GW1 against Kyle, before his team actually woke up. Since then, it’s been nothing but losses: Josiah, Andrew, and now Ron. Losing to Ron is like losing a foot race to someone wearing Crocs — humiliating and preventable.  

Your squad looks like a garage sale. Random pieces, nothing that fits, and everything smells faintly of disappointment. You’re playing this league like you accidentally wandered in while trying to set up an ESPN March Madness bracket.  

“Trophies Matter FC”? Not this season. The only trophy you’re in contention for is *Most Forgettable Manager 2025*.  

---

## 💀 Zryan “FootAndBallFetish” Bhao – 31 pts  
Zryan, I don’t even know where to start. You dropped **31 points** this week and got smoked by Peter — Peter, the guy who hadn’t won a game all season. You’re literally the rehab center of this league, giving washed managers their confidence back. If Peter is the uglier twin who somehow got picked at the bar, you’re the bad lighting that made it possible.  

You’re now **0–4**, the proud owner of the league’s only perfect record — just in the wrong column. Your points total is so pathetic it’s starting to feel like performance art. “FootAndBallFetish”? Bro, the only fetish here is self-sabotage. Your team is kink-shaming itself every week by showing up in public.  

The truth? You’re the league’s welcome mat. Everyone wipes their feet on you on the way to relevance. And at this point, the only suspense is whether you’ll win a single game before the season ends. Spoiler alert: probably not.  

---

## 💀 Roy “This Year FC” Boateng – 30 pts  
Roy, you put up **30 points** this week and somehow still got credited with a win because Chris completely imploded with 24. That’s not a victory, that’s charity. You didn’t beat Chris — Chris beat himself, curled into a ball, and gift-wrapped you the W. You’re basically that guy who shows up late to the group project, writes his name on the cover page, and brags about the A.  

You’re sitting at **4–0**, but let’s not pretend this record means anything. Your opponents so far? Peter (winless until this week), Zryan (human bye week), Noah (league NPC), and now Chris during his worst collapse yet. That’s not an undefeated streak, that’s a cupcake schedule straight out of Alabama football. You’re not a contender, you’re a fraud with a participation trophy.  

And “This Year FC”? Bro, it’s never your year. You’re like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke coming in 3…2…1. Everyone in this league knows it.

Here’s the brutal truth: you’re undefeated, but you’ve got the credibility of a pyramid scheme. The only reason you’re still at the top is because the schedule gods lined you up against the league’s basement dwellers. 

---

## 💀 Chris “Schrödongers” Duncam – 24 pts  
Chris, my guy… **24 points**. That’s not just bad, that’s historic. You’re supposed to be one of the vets of this league, and you just posted a score that looks like a warm-up drill. Losing to Roy’s 30-pointer isn’t just embarrassing, it’s practically a resignation letter.  

Let’s rewind: GW1, you bodied Ron. GW2, you collapsed against Kyle. GW3, you clapped Peter. GW4, you… what even was that? You fielded a squad that looked allergic to football. Schrödongers? More like Schrödinger’s Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over — and this week, they didn’t.  

You’re 2–2 now, but don’t let the record fool you. You’re spiraling, and the rest of the league knows it. If your season had a theme song, it’d be “Circus Music,” because that’s what this looks like.

# 🎤 Final Verdict  
GW4 was absolute bedlam: Peter finally remembered how to manage a team, Josiah kept his spotless record but still looked like a fraud in debt, Sean stole a win like a pickpocket in broad daylight, and Zryan continued his perfect streak of being perfectly useless. Roy somehow stayed undefeated despite scoring like a relegation side, and Chris posted a score so low it should come with a wellness check.  

But let’s not sugarcoat it:  
- Peter finally scraped his first W, but it came with more caveats than a used car warranty.  
- Josiah’s 4–0 record is held together by duct tape, luck, and Venmo debt.  
- Sean’s “comeback” is less redemption arc and more proof even broken slot machines pay out sometimes.  
- Kyle and Andrew are stuck in mid-table purgatory — forever the groomsmen, never the groom.  
- Don and Ron are slug-wrestling for relevance, and the pavement is winning.  
- Noah is an NPC, background noise in everyone else’s highlight reel.  
- Roy’s 4–0 is faker than a Gucci belt in Chinatown — beating clowns doesn’t make you king.  
- Chris is spiraling so fast the only thing keeping him afloat is everyone else’s Venmo payments.  
- And Zryan? He’s not just winless, he’s basically the league’s ATM — everybody eats when they play him.  

GW4 made one thing painfully clear: this league isn’t about skill, it’s about who can avoid humiliation for one more week. Nobody’s chasing glory — you’re all just running from shame, debt, and roast material.
