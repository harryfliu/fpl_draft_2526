# 💀 GW21 FPL Draft League: The Andrew Ascension & The Great Collapse 💀

GW21 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **public execution disguised as a mid-season checkpoint**. The universe decided to shuffle the deck, and the result was a bloodbath so spectacular it should be preserved in the Smithsonian under the title *Portrait of Chaos Unleashed*.

At the top, Andrew — yes, **Andrew** — finally stopped being the league's eternal bridesmaid and delivered a performance so dominant it made everyone else look like they were playing a different sport. Peter quietly continued his monthly dominance, Noah remembered he's supposed to be good, and Zryan somehow beat Josiah in a result so shocking it requires a UN investigation. These four didn't just win — they **obliterated** their opponents with the kind of violence that would make a therapist recommend group counseling.

The mid-table is a graveyard of broken dreams and shattered egos. Chris barely escaped Sean by one point in a battle so close it needed a photo finish, Kyle finally showed up and executed Roy, Ron drew with Harry in the most boring tie of the century, and Peter got absolutely demolished by Andrew despite having a solid week.

At the bottom, Josiah got **publicly humiliated** by Zryan (yes, **ZRYAN**), Roy continued his descent into irrelevance, Don got stomped by Noah, and Sean lost to Chris in the closest L of his life. But none of that matters because **JOSIAH LOST TO ZRYAN**. The fraud king didn't just lose — he got beaten by the league's designated punching bag, and we're all here for it.

Week 21 made one thing clear: nobody is safe. Not even from Zryan.

## 🏆 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 62 pts

Andrew, you finally did it. You didn't just win — you **OBLITERATED** Peter 62-44 in a performance so dominant it should come with a parental advisory warning and a mandatory wellness check for Peter's family. Sixty-two points, weekly winner, $11 richer, and suddenly people are remembering you exist. This wasn't some "oops I lucked into a result" score — this was **controlled dominance**, the kind of lineup that makes the rest of us question if you've been sandbagging all season.

But let's be clear about something: you're still Andrew. You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star and ran him through a dehydrator on the "discount" setting, leaving behind a stringy, vaguely athletic version that makes people squint and wonder if you're actually Vin Diesel's accountant who wandered onto set. You're 11-2 now through January, which is impressive, except everyone knows you're going to choke when it matters most. You're the Arsenal of fantasy football — great regular season, inevitable collapse incoming.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. Your team name is "Cunha Get Me Points," but this week you didn't need Cunha — you just needed everyone else to remember what competence looks like. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually the best manager in the league, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying about not getting enough respect and blaming the universe for your inevitable playoff exit.

Still, respect where it's due: sixty-two points is no joke. You were the only one this week who looked like you could pass a basic footballing IQ test without using Google. For seven days, you're king of the castle. Enjoy the throne, because next week the universe is back to remind you why you're the eternal bridesmaid.

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 49 pts

Noah, you didn't just win — you **demolished** Don 49-24 in a performance so clean it made the rest of us question if you've been replaced by someone competent. Forty-nine points and you beat Don by 25 points, which is like beating a **kindergartner in a spelling bee** — technically impressive, but also deeply embarrassing for the kindergartner. This wasn't just a win — this was a **statement**, a reminder that when you're not busy being everyone's free points generator, you can actually play this game.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, you just beat Don, not prime Barcelona. That's not a trophy — that's a **participation medal** for showing up. You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go** — like someone took a perfectly good pop star and ran him through a discount blender set to "questionable life choices," leaving behind a puffy, confused version that makes people wonder if you're actually Bruno Mars or if you're what happens when Bruno Mars orders himself from Wish.com.

You're 11-1-9 now, which is so mediocre it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*. Your team is still a Craigslist free section after a hoarder's estate sale — random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of disappointment and broken dreams. You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a Disney princess discovers DoorDash and makes it their entire personality.

But let's give credit where it's due: forty-nine points is solid. Beating Don by 25 is like dunking on a **six-foot rim** while wearing platform shoes, but at least you did it with style. Frame it. Tattoo it across your chest. Because it might be the only thing keeping you warm when you're back to being everyone else's free points generator by GW22.

---

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 44 pts

Peter, 44 points and you lost to Andrew 44-62. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K** for maximum humiliation. But here's the thing: you're still the monthly leader with 167 points through GW19-21, which means you're somehow still winning despite losing. You look like if **hepatitis C was a person** — like a walking medical warning label that makes people instinctively back away, wondering if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a disease gets bored and decides to try fantasy football.

"Peattle Pounders"? You're not a Pounder. You're a **Peashooter firing confetti at a brick wall**. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into Monthly Relevance," because every matchup ends with you on the receiving end of a beating, yet somehow you're still collecting monthly prizes like a participation trophy king who refuses to accept his own mediocrity. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people hold their breath when you walk by, like you're a walking biohazard that escaped from a food court dumpster on half-price hot dog day.

You're 11-0-10 now, which is the perfect metaphor for your existence: not good enough to be respected, not bad enough to be pitied, just... there, floating in the middle of the league like a **cosmic anomaly** that nobody knows how to deal with. You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a questionable makeover that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a mascot gets fired, tries to reinvent itself, and fails spectacularly.

But congrats on the monthly prize money, Peter. You're proving that being consistently mediocre is actually a viable strategy, and that's the most Peter thing about you. You're 3-8 in the season standings, but somehow you're winning January. That's like failing the class but acing the participation award. Enjoy your $33, because it's the only thing keeping you from complete irrelevance.

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 42 pts

Zryan, you did it. You actually **did it**. Forty-two points and you beat Josiah 42-26 in a result so shocking it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers in crisis. This wasn't just a win — this was **regicide**. You didn't just beat Josiah — you **exposed** him as the fraud we all knew he was, and you did it while being the league's designated punching bag.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **proving everyone wrong once every 21 weeks**. Every other week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine, your dignity, and whatever's left of your self-respect. But this week? This week you were a **FOOTBALL GOD**. You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used cooking oil instead of adamantium, leaving you with a sheen that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment goes to therapy and gets worse.

You're 7-0-14 now, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you beat Josiah, and that's all that matters. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets drunk and makes terrible life choices.

You beat Josiah by 16 points, which is like beating **prime Michael Jordan in a one-on-one** while wearing sandals and playing with your eyes closed. Your 7-14 record is still catastrophic, but for seven days, you're not the punchline. You're the **HERO**. You're the guy who slayed the fraud king, and we're all here for it.

Enjoy this moment, Zryan. Frame it. Tattoo it across your chest. Build a shrine to it. Because it might be the only win that matters all season, and you'll be back to being everyone's free points generator by GW22.

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 42 pts

Chris, 42 points and you beat Sean 42-41 by one point. That's not a win, that's a **photo finish so close it required a UN investigation and a recount**. You're 11-0-10 now, which is so mediocre it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*. You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a superhero origin story gets confused and creates a middle manager instead of a hero.

"Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Win, because nobody knows if you actually won until the gameweek is over — and this week, you barely won, by one point, against Sean, which is like beating a **turtle in a race** by one inch while also running backwards. You're not quantum, bro. You're just **both mid and lucky at the same time**, existing in a superposition of mediocrity and fortune. You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient, leaving you with an expression that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gives up halfway through.

You beat Sean by one point, which is like winning a **FOOTBALL MATCH** by scoring a goal in the 97th minute while also tripping over your own feet and accidentally falling into the goal. Your 11-10 record is like having a **credit score that's actually just the number zero**, which shouldn't be possible but you've somehow achieved it through sheer determination to be perfectly average while looking competent on paper.

You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**. You speak in theories, cite statistics, use big words, but your team performs like it's running PowerPoint slides from 2003 instead of plays. Every W you get feels like a **statistical hiccup in the matrix**, except the matrix is tired of your excuses and has filed a complaint. You look like you must have been an **auctioneer in your past life and so you've spent this lifetime repenting for it** — like someone who talks too fast and makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment tries to become a motivational speaker and fails spectacularly.

Enjoy your one-point W over Sean, Chris. You're proving that being lucky is sometimes better than being good, and that's the most Chris thing about you.

---

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 41 pts

Sean, 41 points and you lost to Chris 41-42 by one point. That's not a loss, that's a **tragedy in three acts**: hope, disappointment, and everyone laughing at you while you cry into your pillow at night wondering how you lost by one point to Chris. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when Mattel tries to make a discount version of their flagship product and accidentally creates something vaguely unsettling.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the noise a **cartoon pigeon makes when it flies into a window**. And that's you — every single week. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic crime scene that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment files for divorce and gets custody of the worst parts.

You're 12-0-9 now, which puts you in second place, but let's be honest: you just lost by one point to Chris, which is like losing a **spelling bee** to someone who can barely spell their own name. Your season has been a rollercoaster of inconsistency — one week you're a football god with 41 points (oh wait, that's not even that good), the next you're losing by one point and questioning every life choice that led you to this moment.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. Your team is the kind of roster people put together when they're drunk at 3am and think "this will definitely work," except it doesn't work, and you're left with a collection of players that make people question if you've ever actually watched football before.

Enjoy your one-point L to Chris, Sean. You're proving that being good on paper doesn't mean anything when the actual gameweek happens, and that's the most Gweepy thing about you.

---

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 35 pts

Kyle, you finally decided to show up. Thirty-five points and you beat Roy 35-17 in a performance so clean it made the rest of us question if you've been replaced by someone who actually knows what they're doing. This wasn't some "oops I lucked into a result" score — this was **actual football management**, the kind of lineup that makes people respect you, even if they don't want to admit it.

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a quantum state where it's simultaneously good and bad, exciting and boring, relevant and irrelevant, all at the same time until someone actually looks at it and the wave function collapses into whatever reality is most convenient for the narrative. You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height and added it to his waistline** — like someone tried to make a warrior but accidentally ordered the "dad bod" version from Wish.com, leaving behind a stocky, confused version that makes people wonder if you're actually Khal Drogo or if you're what happens when Khal Drogo discovers pizza and makes it his entire personality.

You're 9-0-12 now, which is so mediocre it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** (this week: beat Roy by 18) and **INCREDIBLY BAD** (most other weeks: exist) in the span of the season, which is the kind of consistency that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're a cosmic experiment in what happens when someone tries really hard but the universe is actively working against them. You look like **Otis from sex education** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a coming-of-age protagonist gets confused and becomes a side character instead.

Still, respect where it's due: you beat Roy by 18 points, which is like beating a **PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE** in their own sport while also not trying. For seven days, you're not the punchline. Enjoy it while it lasts, because next week the circus is back on tour and you're usually the guy juggling fire while setting himself on fire.

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 33 pts

Harry, 33 points and you drew with Ron 33-33. That's not a result, that's a **cosmic joke** so perfectly timed it should be preserved in the Museum of Embarrassing Moments under the title *Portrait of Two Managers Who Forgot How to Play Football*. You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a perfectly good actor discovers snacks and makes them his entire personality.

You're 6-2-13 now, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*. Your season has been a highlight reel of self-inflicted wounds, catastrophic decisions, and moments that make people question if you've ever actually watched football before. You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement.

Your team name is "cunha believe it," but every week the rest of us keep answering: no, we really can't. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe for your terrible lineup decisions, your terrible transfer strategy, and your terrible existence.

You drew with Ron, which is like running a **MARATHON** and finishing at the exact same time as someone who's also running backwards while blindfolded and drunk. Your -158 goal difference is so catastrophic it looks like you're actively trying to set a record for worst performance in league history, and you're succeeding spectacularly. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people cross the street when they see you coming, like you're a walking biohazard warning that escaped from a carnival food stand.

Enjoy your draw with Ron, Harry. You're proving that even when you tie, you're still losing, and that's the most Harry thing about you.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 33 pts

Ron, 33 points and you drew with Harry 33-33. That's not a result, that's a **public admission** that you and Harry are perfectly matched in your mediocrity. You're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits**. A slug with a jersey, except the slug is more productive and has better decision-making skills. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a Scooby-Doo character gets confused and tries to solve the mystery of their own relevance.

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison. Every time you manage to scrape 33 points, the entire league side-eyes the calendar like, "Who got cursed this week?" and then realizes it's just Ron being Ron, which is somehow worse than a curse. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets confused and starts collecting DNA samples in its mouth.

You drew with Harry, which is like running a **THREE-LEGGED RACE** with someone who's also missing a leg, and somehow you both fall at the exact same time and call it a tie. Your 11-1-9 record is so mediocre it looks like you're running an **EXPERIMENTAL ART PIECE** titled *What If Being Average Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you're in fifth place, and that's the most confusing thing about this league.

Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug at a retirement home. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you. Your defense oscillates between "mildly competent" and "furniture from IKEA that nobody knows how to assemble." Watching your team is like watching a snail in rush hour: slow, vulnerable, guaranteed to get crushed by something bigger, and leaving a disgusting trail that nobody wants to clean up.

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 11-1-9, still irrelevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. 🐌**

---

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 26 pts

Josiah, you lost. To **ZRYAN**. Twenty-six points and you lost to Zryan 26-42 in a result so embarrassing it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, a hotline for managers in crisis, and a mandatory intervention from concerned friends and family. This wasn't just a loss — this was **the third funeral of the fraud king**. Your fraudulent empire isn't just crumbling, it's been demolished, burned to the ground, and pissed on by Zryan of all people.

You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a rapper discovers loneliness and makes it their entire personality. You don't *win* games, you *outlast* people like a cockroach outlasts a nuclear apocalypse — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow thriving in disaster while everyone wishes you'd just disappear already. Except this week, you didn't outlast anyone. You got **DEMOLISHED** by Zryan, and there's no coming back from that.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people cross the street when they see you coming, like you're a walking biohazard warning that escaped from a food court dumpster on "we're about to close" day.

You're 13-0-8 now, which is still good enough for first place, but everyone knows you're an empty husk floating on luck's tide like driftwood nobody wants to pick up. You lost to Zryan by 16 points, which is like losing a **BOXING MATCH** to someone who's never thrown a punch before, who's also blindfolded, and who's also Zryan. Your fraudulent reign is over. The emperor has no clothes. The wizard is behind the curtain. The participation trophy king whose reign of terror has ended in the most embarrassing way possible.

**THE FRAUD KING HAS BEEN EXPOSED AGAIN, BY ZRYAN, AND IT FEELS SO GOOD. 💀**

---

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 24 pts

Don, 24 points and you lost to Noah 24-49. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K** for maximum humiliation. You look like **Fat Damon** — like someone took a perfectly good actor and put him through a deep fryer, leaving behind a puffy, greasy version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own celebrity and gives up halfway through.

"son4lyfe"? Bro, Son would probably file a **restraining order** if he knew you existed. You're more like **tenth4lyfe**, destined to always be at the bottom, the also-ran, the guy who peaked in preseason and never saw glory again. You lost to Noah by 25 points — congrats, you **DUNKED ON A SIX-FOOT RIM** while wearing platform shoes and still managed to look uncoordinated doing it, except you didn't dunk, you got dunked on, and the rim was laughing at you. You look like you have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement.

You're 9-0-12 now, which is the perfect metaphor for your life: not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... there, floating near the bottom of the league like a **cosmic anomaly** that nobody knows how to deal with. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's autistic son** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a comedian's offspring tries to be funny and fails spectacularly.

Enjoy your 25-point loss to Noah, Don. You're proving that even broken clocks are right twice a day, but you're also proving that even when you're right, you're still wrong, and that's the most Don thing about you.

---

## ⚰️ Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 17 pts

Roy. Seventeen. This wasn't a score, this was a **public execution**. You lost to Kyle 17-35 in a performance so catastrophic it should be preserved in the Louvre under the title *Portrait of a Fraud Finally Exposed*. A few weeks ago, you were strutting around with a 12-0-9 record, chest out, chin high, whispering "this year might be mine." This week? We're burying those hopes six feet deep and dancing on the grave.

This wasn't just a loss. This was a collapse so catastrophic it deserves its own funeral mass. The procession starts here: Kyle carrying the coffin, Andrew awkwardly playing the organ, Peter crying tears of recognition because he knows what it's like to be terrible. Your team didn't show up. They didn't even get on the bus. They sat at home, curled under a blanket, sipping chamomile tea and apologizing for existing. You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind a chunky, questionable version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a discount store tries to make its own Frank Sinatra and fails catastrophically.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're like Spurs on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke happening right now. You're 12-0-9 and somehow people are calling you a fraud, which should tell you everything you need to know about your "dominance." You lost to Kyle by 18 points — that's not a loss, that's **Kyle filming a live-action snuff film with you as the star, director, producer, and only audience member stupid enough to buy a ticket**. You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe for your seventeen-point disaster.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone you're relevant. We are gathered here today to mourn the short, fraudulent life of Roy's credibility. Born Week 1, died Week 21, cause of death: exposure. He leaves behind a hollow 12-9 record, a team allergic to points, and a reputation in ruins. May he rest in peace, because his season sure won't.

**Amen. ⚰️🪦**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW21

GW21 was a **massacre disguised as a mid-season checkpoint**. Andrew finally remembered he's supposed to be elite and delivered a performance so dominant it made everyone else look like they were playing with their feet tied together. Peter quietly continued his monthly dominance despite losing, Noah demolished Don like it was a tutorial level, and Zryan pulled off the upset of the century by beating Josiah, exposing the fraud king once and for all.

Meanwhile, Chris barely escaped Sean by one point in the closest match of the week, Kyle executed Roy in a blowout that should require an investigation, Harry and Ron drew in the most boring tie imaginable, and Don got absolutely demolished by Noah in a result that surprised nobody.

But the real story? **JOSIAH LOST TO ZRYAN**. The fraud king's empire isn't just crumbling — it's been demolished, burned, and pissed on by the league's designated punching bag. Roy scored seventeen points and got exposed as the fraud we always knew he was. Don continues his eternal struggle with relevance.

**Top 3:** Andrew (62) finally proved he's elite, Noah (49) demolished Don and reminded everyone he can actually play, and Peter (44) quietly continues winning monthly prizes despite losing to Andrew — the most Peter thing possible.

Week 21 made one thing clear: nobody is safe. Not even from Zryan.

**See you next week for more carnage. 💀**
