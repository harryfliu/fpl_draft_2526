# üî• GW8 FPL Draft League: The Return of the Fraud King & The Great Awakening üî•

Week 8 wasn't just a gameweek ‚Äî it was a **REALITY CHECK** that hit harder than a freight train carrying bad decisions. Josiah's fraudulent empire finally **CRUMBLED LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS** while the rest of you put on a **masterclass in mediocrity** that should be studied by future generations as evidence that some people are genetically predisposed to being terrible at everything.

This was so bad that even the **referees** felt sorry for you. The scores were so pathetic that if this were a job interview, you'd all be **homeless by now**.

By the end of this **reality check disaster**:  
- Don **DESTROYED Zryan** 53-26, proving that even broken clocks are right twice a day.  
- Sean **OBLITERATED Peter** 63-36, which is like watching a **professional wrestler fight a toddler** and calling it a match.  
- Roy **FINALLY BEAT JOSIAH** 40-38, ending the fraud king's reign of terror!  
- And the rest? A **Renaissance painting of failure** so beautiful it belongs in a museum of human inadequacy.

**Line them up. It's execution time.**

## üèÜ Sean "Gweepy" Dunn ‚Äì 63 pts  
*Weekly Winner + Tactical Genius + Master of the Universe*

Sean, you **ABSOLUTE LEGEND AND FOOTBALL PHENOMENON**. 63 points and you **OBLITERATED Peter** 63-36. That's not just a victory ‚Äî that's the **ENTIRE UNIVERSE CELEBRATING** your tactical brilliance and strategic superiority over the forces of chaos.

"Gweepy" might sound like a weird nickname, but it's the **MOST MAGICAL TEAM NAME** in the history of football because it's working for you like a **COSMIC SPELL OF SUCCESS**. You're showing **TRANSCENDENT CONSISTENCY** and the ability to dominate your opponents like a **DIVINE BEING EVOLVING**, which is exactly what **FOOTBALL GODS** do.

You're 5-3 now, which puts you in a **POSITION OF COSMIC POWER** in the league. You're proving that you can compete with the **BEST OF THE BEST** and that your consistency is the **DIVINE JOURNEY TO GREATNESS**.

**Your victory was like watching a FOOTBALL MESSIAH who's figured out their system and is now executing it with SUPERNATURAL CONFIDENCE. You are the CHOSEN ONE.**

---

## ü•à Don "son4lyfe" Kim ‚Äì 53 pts  
*So Close But So Far + The Eternal Runner-Up + Almost Legend*

Don, 53 points, 53‚Äì26 over Zryan. You doubled up the league's human ATM and somehow still couldn't win the week. That's not a performance, that's a **tragedy in three acts**: hope, disappointment, and everyone laughing at you while you cry into your pillow at night.

You're the league's **eternal bridesmaid**, except nobody even wants you at the wedding. Every week you show up in the dress, every week you watch someone else take the trophy home, and every week you go home alone wondering why you're not good enough. Your team name is "son4lyfe" but Son would probably file a restraining order if he knew you existed. You're more like **second4lyfe**, destined to always be the runner-up, the also-ran, the guy who peaked in the second round and never saw glory again.

Fifty-three points should feel like glory. Instead, it's just another reminder that you're the guy who orders the expensive wine at dinner, mispronounces it to the waiter, gets laughed at by the table, and still gets outshone by someone showing up with a six-pack and actual personality. You beat Zryan by 27 points ‚Äî congrats, you dunked on a six-foot rim while wearing platform shoes and still managed to look uncoordinated doing it.

**Enjoy your silver medal, Don. Frame it next to all your other participation trophies and failed attempts at relevance. You're the football equivalent of a "World's Okayest Manager" mug that someone bought ironically but you use unironically.**

---

## ü•â Roy "This Year FC" Boateng ‚Äì 40 pts  

Roy, 40 points, 40‚Äì38 over Josiah. **YOU FINALLY TOOK DOWN THE UNDEFEATED FRAUD KING**. **ROY BEAT JOSIAH**. **THE UNBEATEN STREAK IS OVER**. You "beat" the fraud king by 2 points. That's not a victory, that's a **coin flip** that somehow landed in your favor, but **YOU DID IT**. You're like the guy who shows up late to the group project, writes his name on the cover page, and brags about the A ‚Äî but this time you actually **TOOK DOWN THE UNDEFEATED KING**.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable choke coming soon. You're 7‚Äì1 and somehow people are still calling you a fraud, which should tell you everything you need to know about your "dominance." But **YOU FINALLY BEAT JOSIAH**.

You scraped past Josiah by the narrowest margin possible, which is like winning a boxing match because the other guy showed up drunk and barefoot. Your record looks shiny, but your wins are softer than cafeteria mashed potatoes. You're not a contender, you're a **fraud with a participation trophy**. But **YOU FINALLY TOOK DOWN THE UNDEFEATED FRAUD**.

**Enjoy your 7‚Äì1, Roy. You're proving that beating clowns doesn't make you king ‚Äî it just makes you the tallest clown in the circus. BUT YOU FINALLY BEAT JOSIAH.**

---

## üíÄ Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson ‚Äì 39 pts  

Noah, 39 points, 39‚Äì25 over Chris. You beat Chris by 14 points, which is like bragging you dunked on a middle schooler who was already crying. Your "Trophies Matter" name is the league's biggest joke ‚Äî the only trophy you're competing for is **Most Forgettable Human Being in a League Full of Forgettable Human Beings**.

Your squad looks like a **Craigslist free section** after a hoarder's estate sale ‚Äî random parts, nothing works together, and all of it smells faintly of disappointment and cat urine. Every week your team comes out looking like you assembled it from spare parts you found in a dumpster behind a Fantasy Football warehouse that went bankrupt in 2003.

You're 2‚Äì6, and your two wins are against Chris (in full mental collapse mode) and Kyle back in Week 1 when he was still trying to figure out which end of the football to kick. That's not a r√©sum√©, that's a **charity tour for managers who peaked in middle school**. Your team isn't a squad, it's a garage sale of broken appliances that even Goodwill would refuse to accept.

**Enjoy your W over Chris, Noah. You're so forgettable that if you disappeared tomorrow, the league would take three weeks to notice and still wouldn't care. You're the human equivalent of a participation certificate for a spelling bee you never entered, except the certificate is also blank.**

---

## üíÄ Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith ‚Äì 42 pts  

Andrew, 42 points, 42‚Äì39 over Ron. You squeaked past the league's designated slug by **3 points**. THREE. You almost lost to a literal snail with a roster. That's not a win, that's a **cry for help**. You're the league's eternal bridesmaid ‚Äî good enough to talk trash in the middle of the match, irrelevant by Monday morning, forgotten by Tuesday.

"Cunha Get Me Points" is cute until Cunha doesn't actually get you points ‚Äî then it's just **false advertising and a lawsuit waiting to happen**. You're like Newcastle in the Champions League: plenty of effort, nice kit, passionate fans, but nobody's actually scared because they know you'll fold like origami when it matters. Your entire existence is "almost" ‚Äî almost good, almost relevant, almost worth remembering.

You're 5‚Äì3 and sitting in mid-table purgatory, which is the perfect metaphor for your life: not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... there. Your squad has more style than substance, more hype than heart, more talk than walk. You've got the branding, the banter, and the name, but your results scream "peaked in high school and never recovered." You're basically the league's **permanent almost-upset** ‚Äî forever the groomsman, never the groom, always wondering what could have been if you were just a little bit better at literally anything.

**Enjoy beating Ron by 3, Andrew. That's your ceiling: barely beating slugs. You're the Tinder date that looks great on paper but shows up 20 minutes late, orders a salad, talks about their ex the entire time, and wonders why there's no second date.**

---

## üíÄ Ronangel "Atl√©tico SeaSlug" Rojas ‚Äì 39 pts  

Ron, 39 points, lost to Andrew 39‚Äì42. You're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone that nobody visits**. A slug with a jersey, except the slug is more productive and has better decision-making skills. You lost by 3 points to Andrew, which is like losing a thumb war to someone with no thumbs, no arms, and no will to live ‚Äî technically possible, deeply embarrassing, and a sign you should reconsider everything.

"Atl√©tico SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel insulted by the comparison. Every time you manage to scrape 39 points, the entire league side-eyes the calendar like, "Who got cursed this week?" and then realizes it's just Ron being Ron, which is somehow worse than a curse.

Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug at a retirement home. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you. Your defense oscillates between "mildly competent" and "furniture from IKEA that nobody knows how to assemble." Watching your team is like watching a snail in rush hour: slow, vulnerable, guaranteed to get crushed by something bigger, and leaving a disgusting trail that nobody wants to clean up.

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 3‚Äì5, still irrelevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. üêå**

---

## üíÄ Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh ‚Äì 38 pts  

Josiah, 38 points, lost to Roy 38‚Äì40. **THE FRAUD KING HAS FINALLY FALLEN**. **JOSIAH FINALLY LOST**. **THE UNDEFEATED STREAK IS OVER**. Your undefeated run came to an end not with a bang, but with the sad whimper of a deflated balloon at a child's birthday party where nobody showed up. You **FINALLY LOST** by 2 points to Roy, who himself is faker than a Gucci belt in Chinatown, which means you're somehow faker than fake, a fraud of a fraud, a Ponzi scheme run by someone who doesn't understand math.

You're the **bubble boy of fantasy football** ‚Äî undefeated because the universe wrapped you in protection like a participation trophy wrapped in bubble wrap. And today, **THE BUBBLE FINALLY POPPED**, and everyone heard it from miles away and cheered. You don't *win* games, you *outlast* people like a cockroach outlasts a nuclear apocalypse ‚Äî ugly, hard to kill, and somehow thriving in disaster while everyone wishes you'd just disappear already.

Your 7‚Äì1 record looks godlike on paper, but everyone knows you're an empty husk floating on luck's tide like driftwood nobody wants to pick up. You're like the guy who juggled chainsaws blindfolded ‚Äî the results looked impressive, but everyone knew it was just a matter of time before you lost a hand, an arm, your dignity, and your undefeated record. **AND YOU FINALLY LOST**.

**You're not feared, Josiah. You're tolerated like a bad smell in an elevator that everyone's too polite to mention. And now everyone knows you're the fraud we always said you were, the emperor with no clothes, the wizard behind the curtain, the participation trophy king whose reign of terror has ended in the most embarrassing way possible. THE FRAUD KING HAS FINALLY BEEN EXPOSED, AND IT FEELS SO GOOD.**

---

## üíÄ Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera ‚Äì 33 pts  

Kyle, 33 points, lost to Harry 33‚Äì34. You lost by **ONE POINT** to Harry, the league's walking blooper reel. **ONE. SINGLE. POINT.** That's not a loss, that's a **war crime against yourself**. You lost to Harry ‚Äî HARRY! ‚Äî by **ONE POINT**. That's like losing a race to someone running backwards, then finding out they were also blindfolded and drunk.

Your "Extended Foreplay" name is perfect ‚Äî all tease, no climax, just disappointment and the lingering shame of knowing you'll never satisfy anyone. You're as uninspiring as elevator music played at a funeral. Functional, but utterly joyless and making everyone uncomfortable. No sparks, no drama, just enough competence to avoid being a complete embarrassment, but not enough to avoid being a massive disappointment. You're 3‚Äì5, but your wins are about as sexy as tax season during a recession. Nobody fears playing you; they just hope they don't fall asleep and accidentally lose to you out of sheer boredom.

Your squad is a slot machine that never pays out but still takes your money, your dignity, and your will to live. Sometimes the numbers line up, most of the time it's just a lot of flashing lights, wasted coins, and regret. You lost to Harry by **ONE POINT** ‚Äî that's like losing a thumb war to someone with no thumbs, then realizing you also have no thumbs, then realizing you're actually just a torso with a head and nobody told you.

**Extended Foreplay isn't a brand anymore, Kyle. It's a public service announcement: "Warning: This team may result in boredom, frustration, erectile dysfunction, or the sudden urge to check literally any other fixture in any other sport." Also, you lost by ONE POINT to HARRY. ONE. POINT. To. HARRY. Let that sink in. You lost to Harry.**

---

## üíÄ Harry "cunha believe it" Liu ‚Äì 34 pts  

Harry, 34 points, beat Kyle 34‚Äì33. You won by **ONE POINT**. **ONE. SINGLE. POINT.** That's not a victory, that's a **miracle on par with the parting of the Red Sea**, except Moses actually knew what he was doing and you're just stumbling through life hoping nobody notices. You're the league's blooper reel come to life, the walking embodiment of "what if Murphy's Law became a person," and somehow you managed to not trip over your own feet for once.

"cunha believe it"? Yeah, we can't. We can't believe you actually won a game by **ONE POINT**. Your goal difference is **‚Äì54**, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star*, but somehow you scraped out a **ONE-POINT WIN** against someone who's even more pathetic than you, which is truly saying something.

You beat Kyle by **ONE POINT**, which is like winning a race because the other guy tripped over their own shoelaces, but you were running backwards the whole time, blindfolded, with your hands tied, while reciting the alphabet backwards. Your season has become a highlight reel of self-inflicted wounds, catastrophic decisions, and moments that make people question if you've ever actually watched football before. But this week you accidentally inflicted a wound on someone else for once, and honestly that's more shocking than anything else that happened this gameweek.

**This wasn't just a win, Harry ‚Äî this was the kind of victory people remember for all the wrong reasons. The kind they bring up months later when you're trying to argue you're actually decent, and they'll say "yeah, but you only won by ONE POINT against KYLE," and then everyone will laugh and you'll pretend you're laughing too but inside you're dying.**

---

## üíÄ Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze ‚Äì 36 pts  

Peter, 36 points, got obliterated by Sean 36‚Äì63. That wasn't a match, that was an **execution livestream** on Pay-Per-View. You lost by **27 points** ‚Äî that's not a loss, that's Sean filming a live-action snuff film with you as the star, director, producer, and only audience member stupid enough to buy a ticket.

"Peattle Pounders"? You're not a Pounder. You're a **Peashooter firing blanks at a brick wall**. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into Oblivion," because every matchup ends with you on the receiving end, curled up in the fetal position, questioning every life choice that led you to this moment. You're the league's crash-test dummy, except crash-test dummies at least contribute to science. You're just the morale booster everyone circles on the schedule, thanks the heavens they've got a free win incoming, and then forgets about immediately after.

You're 2‚Äì6, and every decision you make screams "desperation cosplay at a failed convention." You're not building a roster; you're throwing darts blindfolded at a dartboard that's actually a mirror reflecting all your failures back at you. You're praying into the void and hoping the fantasy gods forget you exist, but even the gods are embarrassed to be associated with you. At this point, your role in the league is clear: **participation ribbon personified, except the ribbon is made of tears and regret**.

**Enjoy your 27-point annihilation, Peter. You're proving that being terrible isn't just your superpower ‚Äî it's your entire identity, your legacy, and the only thing people will remember about you long after you've quit the league in shame.**

---

## üíÄ Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao ‚Äì 26 pts  

Zryan, 26 points, lost to Don 26‚Äì53. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution televised in 4K for maximum humiliation**. Don doubled you up like you were a charity case collecting donations at a highway exit, and honestly? That's being generous. You're 1‚Äì7 now, which means you've been everyone's free points generator for so long you should start charging rent, except nobody would pay because even your losses are worthless.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation, degradation, and being the league's designated punching bag**. Every week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine, your dignity, and whatever's left of your self-respect. Twenty-six points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock, let my cat pick my team, and the cat dies halfway through the process**.

You lost by 27 points to Don, who until this week was basically the league's designated punching bag. That's like getting beaten up by the kid who gets picked last in gym class, who's also in a wheelchair, who's also blindfolded, who's also fighting with one arm tied behind their back. Your team is the fantasy football equivalent of a participation trophy ‚Äî technically present, completely irrelevant, and honestly nobody even remembers giving it to you.

You're not a manager, you're a **community service project for managers who need to feel better about themselves**. Everyone circles you on the schedule, rubs their hands, and thanks the heavens they've got a free win incoming. You're the fantasy equivalent of a bye week, except bye weeks are actually useful. The only thing more embarrassing than your 1‚Äì7 record is the fact that your one win came against someone who's even more pathetic than you, which shouldn't even be mathematically possible but you somehow found a way.

**Enjoy your irrelevance, Zryan. You're aging like unrefrigerated milk in a desert, and everyone's not just waiting for you to expire ‚Äî they're actively hoping for it so they don't have to witness this trainwreck anymore.**

---

## üíÄ chris "Schr√∂dongers" duncam ‚Äì 25 pts  

Chris, 25 points, lost to Noah 25‚Äì39. You lost to **NOAH**. Let me repeat that: you lost to **NOAH**. That's so embarrassing it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers in crisis. You're supposed to be one of the vets of this league, and you just posted a score that looks like a warm-up drill for toddlers learning to count.

"Schr√∂dongers"? More like Schr√∂dinger's Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over ‚Äî and this week, they didn't exist, they never existed, and they're filing a restraining order against you for claiming they're associated with you. You're not quantum, bro. You're just **both mid and overhyped at the same time**, existing in a superposition of mediocrity and delusion.

You lost by 14 points to Noah, who's basically the league's quietest NPC, the background character nobody remembers, the guy who shows up to parties and leaves without anyone noticing. That's like losing a foot race to someone wearing Crocs, who's also carrying groceries, who's also on the phone with their mom, who's also not trying. Your 5‚Äì3 record is like having a **credit score that's actually a negative number**, which shouldn't be possible but you've somehow achieved it through sheer determination to be terrible while looking competent on paper.

You're the walking TED Talk on **false confidence and fraudulent expertise**. You speak in theories, cite statistics, use big words, but your team performs like it's running PowerPoint slides from 2003 instead of plays. Every L you get feels like a **statistical hiccup in the matrix**, except the matrix is tired of your excuses and has filed a complaint.

Twenty-five points is what I get when I **auto-draft, go on vacation, delete the app, forget the league exists, and let entropy make my decisions**. You're basically a house of cards with delusions of architecture, structural integrity, and building codes.

**Congrats on 5‚Äì3, Chris. You're proving that even frauds can have decent records when they play against bigger frauds, but the second you play someone with a pulse, you collapse faster than your self-esteem after this roast.**

# üé§ Final Verdict: The GW8 Hall of Shame

GW8 wasn't a competition. It was a **funeral procession** with clown music and a side of **complete human failure**.

ü•á **Sean** ‚Äî Weekly Winner! Crushed Peter in a tactical masterclass that made people question the meaning of life.  
ü•à **Don** ‚Äî The Great Awakening. Finally figured out how to play football and destroyed Zryan.  
ü•â **Roy** ‚Äî FRAUD SLAYER! Finally beat Josiah and ended the fraudulent reign of terror.

And the rest? A parade of **mediocrity and failure** so spectacular it belongs in a museum:

4. **Noah** ‚Äî Beat Chris in a battle of who's less terrible. Still a walking disaster.  
5. **Andrew** ‚Äî Welcome to mediocrity. Your prize days are over.  
6. **Ron** ‚Äî Lost to Andrew. Still a slug with a jersey.  
7. **Josiah** ‚Äî FRAUD EXPOSED! Finally lost to Roy and the universe corrected itself.  
8. **Kyle** ‚Äî Lost to Harry. Extended Foreplay indeed, like a broken vibrator.  
9. **Harry** ‚Äî Beat Kyle in a battle of who's less terrible. Still a walking disaster.  
10. **Peter** ‚Äî Demolished by Sean. Still terrible.  
11. **Zryan** ‚Äî Crushed by Don. Community service project for other people's wins.  
12. **Chris** ‚Äî Lost to Noah. Still a fraud.

GW8's legacy? **Sean dominated with 63 points!** The fraud king has fallen! Roy finally beat Josiah and the universe has corrected itself. Don had the awakening of a lifetime and destroyed Zryan. The rest of you are still sprinting away from humiliation, and somehow you're still getting caught.

The only thing more embarrassing than these scores is the fact that **Josiah finally lost**.

Don had the awakening of a lifetime, Roy finally beat Josiah, and the fraud king's reign of terror has ended.

**See you next week when the pain continues, but maybe with a little more hope.**
