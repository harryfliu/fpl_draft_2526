# 💀 GW26 FPL Draft League: Harry's Redemption Tour & The Great Fraud Collapse 💀

GW26 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **reckoning disguised as fantasy football**. The universe looked at the standings, laughed maniacally, and decided to turn everything upside down like a drunk toddler playing with a snow globe. Harry — yes, **HARRY** — dropped 61 points and won both the weekly AND monthly prizes, proving that even a broken clock that looks like Matt Damon's rejected twin can have its moment. Meanwhile, the "elite" crumbled like stale cookies at a retirement home.

At the top, Harry finally remembered he's supposed to be playing football and delivered a performance so dominant it made everyone question if he sold his soul at a discount gas station. Kyle showed up with 53 points like he actually cares, Noah put up 50 in a win, and Don somehow scraped together 42 points despite being Don. These managers didn't just win — they **survived** while others drowned in their own mediocrity.

The middle of the pack is a wasteland of broken dreams and shattered egos. Josiah's fraud empire continues its slow-motion collapse, Peter is somehow in second place despite being terrible, and Andrew lost to Sean in a battle that nobody wanted to watch. But here's the real story: **Harry won $33 this month** while sitting in TWELFTH PLACE with a 9-2-15 record that looks like a basketball score gone wrong.

At the bottom, Roy squeaked past Chris in a game that made everyone watching dumber, Ron got absolutely demolished by Noah, and Zryan continues his heroic quest to finish dead last with the determination of a lemming sprinting toward a cliff.

Week 26 made one thing clear: chaos reigns, nothing makes sense, and Harry Liu — yes, HARRY LIU — is $33 richer while everyone else questions their life choices.

## 🏆 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 61 pts

Harry, what the actual fuck just happened? Sixty-one points, weekly winner, monthly winner, $33 richer. You didn't just win — you **committed highway robbery in broad daylight** while everyone watched in horror. This wasn't some fluke, some lucky bounce, some "oh the stars aligned" moment — this was **systematic domination** from a man who's spent most of the season looking like he wandered onto the pitch by accident and decided to stay because the snacks were free.

You beat Josiah 61-43 like you were playing against a drunk toddler. You won the month with 158 points while sitting in **TWELFTH PLACE** with a 9-2-15 record that's so catastrophically bad it looks like a typo, except it's not a typo, it's your actual season, and that somehow makes it worse. You're dead last in the league standings but $33 richer, which is the most Harry thing that's ever happened in the history of Harry things happening. You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar and ate the entire thing in one sitting** — bloated, satisfied, and deeply concerning to everyone watching.

Your team name is "cunha believe it," and honestly, no, we really can't believe it. We can't believe you won. We can't believe you scored 61 points. We can't believe you're $33 richer despite being the worst team in the league by record. You have a face so boring that **people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement**, but this week the wall was you, and somehow we couldn't look away from the trainwreck of success happening in slow motion.

Your 9-2-15 record is a **monument to inconsistency, chaos, and the universe's sick sense of humor**. You've got the goal difference of a team that's been relegated three times (-126), the win percentage of a participation trophy recipient, and somehow you just pocketed $33 like a reverse Robin Hood who steals from everyone and gives to himself. You're proof that **God has a sense of humor and it's specifically designed to torture the rest of this league**.

But here's the thing: you earned this. Sixty-one points is legitimate. Beating Josiah by 18 is legitimate. Winning the month is legitimate. You're still terrible, you're still 9-2-15, you're still going to finish last, but for one glorious week and one glorious month, you were **king of the castle**, and everyone else can cry about it while you count your money like Scrooge McDuck if he looked like a discount Matt Damon and had the personality of unsalted crackers.

Enjoy your $33, Harry. You've proven that even the worst team in the league can have its moment, and that moment is now, and it's beautiful in the same way a dumpster fire is beautiful — horrifying, mesmerizing, and impossible to explain to anyone who wasn't there to witness it.

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 53 pts

Kyle, 53 points and you beat Don 53-42 like a man who actually remembered he's playing fantasy football. This is the second-highest score of the week, which would be impressive if we didn't know you're capable of scoring 17 points and looking confused about how numbers work. You're 12-0-14 now, which is perfectly balanced in the most Kyle way possible — not good enough to be elite, not bad enough to be pitied, just **aggressively mediocre with occasional flashes of competence**.

"Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your season is the longest, most unsatisfying buildup to absolutely nothing. You look like **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height and added it to his waistline** — like someone tried to make a warrior but accidentally ordered the "dad bod deluxe" package from Wish.com and just rolled with it. Your team exists in a quantum state where it's simultaneously good and bad until the gameweek ends, and then it's just... there, floating in mediocrity like a corpse in a river that nobody wants to fish out.

You're sixth in the standings despite having a negative goal difference (-77), which is like being proud of passing a test you definitely failed. Your record is 12-0-14, which means you've won exactly as many games as you've lost, proving that you're the **human embodiment of a coin flip** — sometimes heads, sometimes tails, always leaving everyone wondering why they're gambling on you in the first place.

But this week? This week you showed up. Fifty-three points is real. Beating Don by 11 is real. You're proving that **Schrödinger's Manager** can occasionally open the box and find a live cat instead of a dead one, except the cat is still half-dead and confused about how it got there. You look like **Otis from Sex Education** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're always one conversation away from saying something that makes everyone uncomfortable.

Enjoy your 53 points, Kyle. You're 12-0-14, sitting in sixth, proving that being perfectly average is somehow a strategy, and that strategy is working just well enough to keep you relevant but not well enough to make anyone actually respect you.

---

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 50 pts

Noah, 50 points and you **demolished** Ron 50-25 like you were playing against a sea cucumber that forgot how to move. This wasn't a win — this was a **public execution broadcast in IMAX** for maximum humiliation. You beat Ron by 25 points, which is the equivalent of dunking on a toddler while wearing platform shoes and still managing to tear your ACL in the process. You look like **Bruno Mars let himself go** — like someone took a perfectly good pop star and ran him through a discount blender set to "questionable life choices and too many Big Macs."

"Trophies Matter FC"? Bro, you're 14-1-11, which is good enough for fourth place but not good enough to make anyone think you're actually winning anything. Your total points (989) are the lowest in the top six, which means you're winning games through sheer dumb luck and the fact that your opponents keep forgetting to set their lineups. You look like **Pocahontas who had too many Big Macs** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a Disney character gets access to a drive-through and never looks back.

Your goal difference (+83) is respectable, but let's be honest: you've been feasting on the bottom-feeders like Ron, Zryan, and Chris while getting absolutely demolished by anyone competent. Beating Ron by 25 is like beating a **sloth in a race where the sloth is also dead** — technically impressive, but also deeply concerning because what does it say about you that this is your highlight?

But credit where it's due: 50 points is solid. Beating Ron into oblivion is always satisfying. You're 14-1-11 and sitting in fourth, which means you're **relevant enough to matter but not good enough to win**, and that's the most Noah thing about you. You're the guy who shows up to the party with a six-pack when everyone else brought wine, and somehow people are grateful you came even though they're actively hoping you leave early.

Enjoy your 50 points, Noah. You're proving that being slightly above average is enough to beat the league's designated punching bags, and that's a legacy worth... absolutely nothing. But hey, at least you're not Ron.

---

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 43 pts

Josiah, you scored 43 points and lost to Harry 43-61. Let me repeat that: **you lost to HARRY**. You lost to Harry Liu, the man who looks like Matt Damon's rejected clone, the man who's 9-2-15, the man who's sitting in TWELFTH PLACE while you're sitting in first. This wasn't just a loss — this was **the universe itself bending over backwards to expose you as the fraud king you've always been**.

You're 16-0-10 now, still first in the standings, but everyone can see the cracks forming in your fraudulent empire like a condemned building that's one sneeze away from total collapse. You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone** — like someone tried to make a rapper but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient and just went with it. Your goal difference is +34, which is somehow the third-best in the league despite you being exposed as a fraud more times than a politician at a fact-checking convention.

You lost to Harry by 18 points. **HARRY**. The man who's dead last. The man who has a -126 goal difference. The man who just pocketed $33 while you're sitting there with your first-place trophy made of participation ribbons and broken dreams. You don't *win* games, Josiah — you **survive** them like a cockroach survives a nuclear blast, ugly, unwanted, and somehow still here despite everyone's best efforts to exterminate you.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, panicked, clinging to first place like a drowning man clings to driftwood. You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a food court dumpster gains sentience and decides to play fantasy football.

But here's the truth: you're still first. You're 16-0-10. You've got 48 league points. You're winning this league despite being exposed as a fraud more times than a telemarketer selling extended car warranties. You're **the emperor with no clothes**, except everyone can see you're naked, everyone's pointing and laughing, and you're still standing there acting like you're wearing the finest silk while Harry just robbed you blind and walked away $11 richer.

Enjoy your first place while it lasts, Josiah. The fraud king's empire is crumbling, and everyone's here for the collapse.

---

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 42 pts

Don, 42 points and you lost to Kyle 42-53. That's not a loss, that's a **statement of mediocrity** carved in stone and displayed in a museum titled "Men Who Almost Matter But Don't." You look like **Fat Damon** — like someone took a perfectly good actor and ran him through a deep fryer set to "maximum disappointment," leaving behind a puffy, greasy version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a celebrity goes to a discount clone factory.

"son4lyfe"? Bro, Son would file a **restraining order** if he knew you existed. You're more like **second4lyfe**, destined to always be the runner-up, the also-ran, the guy who shows up to the race wearing running shoes but somehow ends up walking the whole thing while everyone laps you. You're 10-1-15 now, sitting in eleventh place, which is the perfect metaphor for your entire existence: not bad enough to be memorable, not good enough to be respected, just **there**, floating in the middle like a turd in a punch bowl that nobody wants to acknowledge.

You scored 42 points, which is respectable on paper but deeply sad when you realize you lost to Kyle by 11. Kyle! The human coin flip! The man who exists in a quantum state of mediocrity! And you lost to him by double digits like you forgot how to count past ten. Your goal difference is +61, which would be impressive if we didn't know you've been padding your stats against the league's bottom-feeders like you're a cat playing with dead mice.

You look like you have a **face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement**. Your team is the kind of roster people put together in charity leagues for sick kids, except the sick kids would feel **insulted by the comparison** and demand better options. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's autistic son** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're always one sentence away from saying something that makes everyone uncomfortable.

Enjoy your loss to Kyle, Don. You're 10-1-15, sitting in eleventh, proving that being consistently mediocre is somehow worse than being consistently terrible, because at least terrible teams are entertaining. You're just... Don. And that's the saddest part of all.

---

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 40 pts

Sean, 40 points and you beat Andrew 40-35 in a battle that made everyone watching dumber. This was like watching two slugs race except both slugs were also drunk and confused about which direction the finish line was. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a toy manufacturer tries to save money by using recycled disappointment as the primary material.

"Gweepy" isn't a team name, it's the **noise a cartoon character makes when they realize they've made a terrible mistake**. And that's you — every single week. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. You're 14-0-12 now, sitting in fifth place, which is respectable if we ignore the fact that your goal difference is +76 and you've been winning games by the skin of your teeth like a man who's allergic to dominant victories.

You beat Andrew by 5 points, which is like beating someone in arm wrestling except you both had noodles for arms and the contest lasted three hours. Forty points is the kind of score that makes people say "well, at least you tried," except you didn't really try, you just existed, and existence was enough to beat Andrew, which says more about Andrew than it does about you.

You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic experiment that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science lab gets drunk and starts mixing random samples together just to see what happens. Your season has been a highlight reel of inconsistency — one week you're dropping 63 points, the next you're limping to 40 and calling it a win.

But hey, you won. You beat Andrew. You're 14-0-12 in fifth place. You're proving that **mediocrity with occasional competence** is a viable strategy, and that strategy is working just well enough to keep you relevant but not well enough to make anyone actually fear you.

Enjoy your 40 points, Sean. You're the human embodiment of "meh," and that's exactly where you belong.

---

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 35 pts

Andrew, 35 points and you lost to Sean 35-40. That's not a loss, that's a **confession of inadequacy** written in crayon and submitted to a board that doesn't care. You're the league's eternal bridesmaid, the guy who's always close but never quite there, like a participation trophy that gained sentience and decided to play fantasy football. You look like **Thin Diesel** — like someone took a perfectly good action star and put him through a dehydrator, leaving behind a husk that vaguely resembles what used to be cool.

You're 14-2-10 now, sitting in third place with a goal difference of +93, which would be impressive if we didn't know you've been feasting on the bottom-feeders while getting absolutely demolished by anyone competent. You lost to Sean by 5 points, which is like losing a race to someone who's also walking except they're slightly less out of shape than you are. Thirty-five points is what people score when they **forget to set their lineup but the app auto-fills it anyway**.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, confused, somehow still trying to convince everyone you're elite when everyone can see you're just... good. Not great. Not elite. Just good. You're the guy who brings expensive wine to the party but still gets outshone by someone showing up with a six-pack, and that someone is Sean, which should tell you everything you need to know about where you stand.

You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually the best team in the league, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying about how you should be winning more and blaming the universe for your shortcomings. Your team is good on paper, solid in execution, but lacking that **killer instinct** that separates the elite from the almost-elite, and you're firmly in the almost-elite category, which is the worst category to be in because it means you're good enough to know better but not good enough to do better.

Enjoy your loss to Sean, Andrew. You're 14-2-10 in third place, proving that being consistently good is somehow not good enough, and that's the most Andrew thing about you.

---

## 💀 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 35 pts

Roy, 35 points and you beat Chris 35-31 in a battle that made everyone watching question if they were actually watching fantasy football or if they'd accidentally tuned into a documentary about mediocrity. You look like **Tank Sinatra** — like someone took a perfectly good crooner and put him through a meat grinder, leaving behind a chunky, questionable version that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a lounge singer has a mid-life crisis.

"This Year FC"? Bro, it's **never your year**. You're 13-0-13, sitting in sixth place with a goal difference of -94 that's so catastrophically bad it looks like you've been playing a different sport entirely. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable mediocrity settling in like a fog that never lifts. You beat Chris by 4 points, which is like dunking on a **six-foot rim** while wearing platform shoes and still somehow managing to miss twice before you made it.

Thirty-five points is what you score when you **roll out of bed, check your phone, realize it's gameweek day, and panic-set your lineup while taking a shower**. This wasn't a performance, this was survival. You didn't beat Chris — you outlasted him like a cockroach outlasts a nuclear blast, and that's not a compliment, that's an observation about your ability to **refuse to die despite everyone wishing you would**.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who's starting to realize they can't perform forever** — desperate, panicked, clinging to mediocrity like it's a life raft. You're 13-0-13, which is the most perfectly balanced terrible record in the league. You've won exactly as many games as you've lost, proving that you're the **human embodiment of a stalemate**, and nobody wants to be in a stalemate with you because it means they have to spend more time thinking about you.

Enjoy your 35 points and your win over Chris, Roy. You're proving that being perfectly average is somehow a strategy, except it's not a good strategy, it's just... a strategy. And that's the saddest part.

---

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 34 pts

Peter, 34 points and you beat Zryan 34-28. Congratulations on beating the league's designated punching bag by 6 points. That's like winning a race against someone who's **running backwards while blindfolded** — technically impressive, but also deeply concerning because what does it say about you that this is your highlight? You look like if **hepatitis C was a person** — like a walking medical warning that makes people instinctively cross the street when they see you coming.

"Peattle Pounders"? You're not a Pounder. You're a **Peashooter firing blanks at a brick wall** while the wall laughs at you. Your team name should be "Peattle Pounded Into The Dirt," because every week is a reminder that you somehow stumbled into second place despite being objectively terrible at this. You're 15-0-11 with a goal difference of +76, which would be impressive if we didn't know you've been winning games through sheer dumb luck and the fact that your opponents keep forgetting to field a team.

You beat Zryan by 6 points, which is like beating a **corpse in a swimming race** — technically true, deeply unimpressive, and it raises more questions than it answers. Thirty-four points is what you score when you **accidentally leave your laptop open and your cat walks across the keyboard during lineup selection**, except the cat made better choices than you did on purpose.

You look like you **smell like hot dog water** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that lingers in the air like a bad memory. You look like a **lesbian version of the Wendy's mascot** — like someone took a perfectly good fast-food icon and gave it a questionable makeover that makes people uncomfortable. You're in SECOND PLACE despite being terrible, which is the most Peter thing that's ever happened.

Enjoy your 34 points and your win over Zryan, Peter. You're 15-0-11 in second place, proving that the universe has a sense of humor and that sense of humor is specifically designed to make everyone else question reality.

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 31 pts

Chris, 31 points and you lost to Roy 31-35. You lost to **ROY**. Roy Boateng. The man with a -94 goal difference. The man who's 13-0-13. The man who's the human embodiment of "meh." And you lost to him by 4 points like you forgot how to count to ten. You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a child actor grows up but never grows out of looking confused.

"Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's Points, because nobody knows if they exist until the week is over, and this week they definitely didn't exist, they never existed, and they're filing a **restraining order** against you for claiming they're associated with you. You're not quantum, bro. You're just **both mid and overhyped at the same time**, existing in a superposition of mediocrity and delusion that collapses into disappointment every single week.

You're 12-0-14, sitting in eighth place with a goal difference of -31, which is the perfect metaphor for your season: slightly below average in every measurable way. You lost to Roy by 4 points, which is like losing a **spelling bee to someone who can't read** — it shouldn't be possible, but here we are, living in a reality where you made it possible.

You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob had a face** — like someone tried to make a person but accidentally used disappointment as the main ingredient, leaving you with an expression that makes people instinctively avoid eye contact. You look like you must have been an **auctioneer in your past life** and so you've spent this lifetime repenting for it by being as boring and disappointing as humanly possible.

Enjoy your loss to Roy, Chris. You're 12-0-14 in eighth place, proving that being slightly below average is somehow your superpower, and that superpower is working exactly as intended: making everyone forget you exist until you do something embarrassing like lose to Roy.

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 25 pts

Ron, 25 points and you lost to Noah 25-50. That's not a loss, that's a **public execution broadcast on every streaming platform simultaneously** for maximum humiliation. You got beaten by 25 points, which is the equivalent of showing up to a knife fight with a **spoon made of wet cardboard**. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you, like you're what happens when a cartoon character escapes into the real world and immediately regrets it.

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards, except they don't feel that bad because you're also kind of gross. You're 12-2-12, sitting in seventh place with a goal difference of +67 that you've accumulated through sheer persistence and the fact that you occasionally beat people who are even more terrible than you are.

You scored 25 points, which is what I get when I **forget fantasy football exists, remember it exists three hours before kickoff, panic-set my lineup while grocery shopping, and the grocery store loses power**. This wasn't a performance, this was a **cry for help disguised as a box score**. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic experiment that makes scientists question if they should have stopped while they were ahead.

Your attack is about as threatening as a **group hug at a funeral** — everyone's uncomfortable, nobody knows what's happening, and someone's crying but it's not clear if it's from sadness or embarrassment. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, except the traffic cones would demand a trade because they have more self-respect than being associated with you. Your defense is held together with duct tape and prayers, except the prayers aren't being answered because even God has given up on you.

You lost to Noah by 25 points, which is like losing a **race to someone who's also crawling except they're slightly more motivated** than you are. You're 12-2-12 in seventh place, proving that being aggressively mediocre is somehow a viable strategy for staying relevant, except you're not really relevant, you're just... there. Like a stain on a carpet that nobody wants to clean up because it's not worth the effort.

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 12-2-12, still irrelevant, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be good at this. 🐌**

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 28 pts

Zryan, 28 points and you lost to Peter 28-34. You lost to **PETER**. Peter Henze. The man who looks like hepatitis C gained sentience. The man who shouldn't be winning anything. And you lost to him by 6 points like you were actively trying to lose but couldn't even do that convincingly. You look like if **Wolverine's super power was greasy skin** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used cooking oil instead of adamantium, leaving you with a sheen that makes people question if you're sweating or if that's just how you look.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **humiliation, degradation, and being the league's designated punching bag**. You're 11-0-15, sitting in tenth place with a goal difference of -162 that's so catastrophically bad it looks like you've been playing against professional teams while fielding a squad of geriatric hamsters. Every week you bend over and let another manager collect rent on your spine, your dignity, and whatever's left of your self-respect, which at this point is approximately zero.

Twenty-eight points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock, let my dog pick my team by walking across the keyboard, and the dog dies halfway through**. This wasn't a performance, this was a **funeral for your dignity broadcast in 4K** for maximum clarity. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that makes people question if you're actually human or if you're what happens when a science experiment gets drunk on a Tuesday.

You lost to Peter by 6 points, which is like losing a **swimming race to a brick** — it shouldn't be possible, but you made it happen through sheer determination to be terrible. Your 11-0-15 record is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **experimental art piece** titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Star Exhibit*, except nobody's buying tickets and you're performing for an empty theater.

You're not a manager, you're a **community service project for managers who need to feel better about themselves**. Everyone circles you on the schedule, rubs their hands together like a cartoon villain, and thanks the fantasy gods they've got a free win incoming. You're the fantasy equivalent of a bye week, except bye weeks are actually useful for resting players, and you're just useful for inflating everyone else's win totals.

**Enjoy your 28 points and your loss to Peter, Zryan. You're 11-0-15 in tenth place, proving that being consistently terrible is somehow your only consistent quality, and that quality is working exactly as intended: making everyone else feel better about themselves. 🗑️**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW26

GW26 was a **circus disguised as fantasy football**, and the clowns were running the show. Harry Liu — yes, **HARRY LIU** — dropped 61 points and won both the weekly and monthly prizes, pocketing $33 while sitting in dead last with a 9-2-15 record that looks like a typo but isn't. Kyle showed up with 53 points, Noah demolished Ron by 25, and Don scored 42 in a loss that nobody will remember.

Meanwhile, Josiah lost to Harry and everyone's favorite fraud empire continues its slow-motion collapse. Peter beat Zryan in a battle of who's less terrible and somehow emerged victorious despite being objectively bad at this. Andrew lost to Sean in a game that made everyone watching dumber. Roy squeaked past Chris by 4 points in a matchup that should have been canceled for everyone's benefit. And Ron got absolutely obliterated by Noah in a performance so bad it should come with a trigger warning.

**Top 3:** Harry (61) proved that even broken clocks can win big when they want to, Kyle (53) showed up for once, and Noah (50) beat Ron so badly it might be considered a war crime in some jurisdictions.

**Bottom 3:** Ron (25) got demolished, Zryan (28) continues his heroic quest to finish last, and Chris (31) lost to Roy which is somehow worse than being in the bottom 3.

**The Story:** Harry Liu is $33 richer, sitting in twelfth place, laughing all the way to the bank while everyone else questions how this happened. Josiah's fraud empire is crumbling. Peter is in second place despite being terrible. And Zryan is still everyone's favorite punching bag.

Week 26 made one thing clear: nothing makes sense, chaos reigns supreme, and Harry Liu just robbed everyone blind while looking like Matt Damon's rejected twin. What a time to be alive.
