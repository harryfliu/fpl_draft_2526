# 💀 GW20 FPL Draft League: The Great Implosion & The Fraud King's Reckoning 💀

GW20 wasn't just a gameweek — it was a **cosmic correction disguised as fantasy football**. The universe looked at the standings, laughed, and said "let's ruin some lives today." What followed was a massacre so spectacular it should be preserved in a museum under the title *Portrait of Chaos Unleashed*.

At the top, Roy finally remembered he's supposed to be elite and delivered a performance so dominant it made everyone else look like they were playing a different sport. Peter crawled out of the basement long enough to remind us he's not completely useless, Chris proved Schrödinger's cat is alive (for now), and Noah beat Sean in a result that surprised absolutely nobody because this league has no rules anymore.

But the real story? **Josiah got absolutely destroyed**. Twenty points. TWENTY. The fraud king didn't just lose — he got **publicly executed in 4K** while Chris danced on his grave and the entire league watched with popcorn. Kyle and Harry continued their tour of mediocrity, Andrew lost to ZRYAN (yes, THAT Zryan), and Don finally remembered how to win.

Week 20 made one thing clear: this league is pure chaos, nobody is safe, and Josiah's crown is made of cardboard.

## 🏆 Roy "This Year FC" Boateng — 56 pts

Roy, you didn't just win — you **committed first-degree murder on live television**. Fifty-six points and you beat Ron 56-39 in a performance so dominant it should come with a trigger warning. This wasn't some "I got lucky" score — this was **controlled demolition**, the kind of lineup that makes people remember why they were scared of you in the first place.

You look like **Tank Sinatra if he actually hit the gym** — like someone took a perfectly mediocre crooner and gave him just enough success to be dangerous. Your 12-8 record puts you in third place, and for once nobody's calling you a fraud because you just dropped 56 points like it was nothing. This is the Roy we were promised — dominant, ruthless, and making Ron look like a community college dropout trying to explain quantum physics.

"This Year FC"? For once, it might actually BE your year, except we all know you're going to choke when it matters most. You're like Arsenal on steroids: fast start, lots of noise, inevitable collapse coming in February. You have the expression of an **aging performer who just remembered he can still perform** — confident, dangerous, and somehow still trying to convince everyone this isn't a fluke.

But let's give credit where it's due: fifty-six points is no accident. That's the kind of score that makes people check the rules to make sure you're not cheating. You didn't just beat Ron — you **violated** him, left him questioning his life choices, and reminded everyone why they circled your name on the schedule with a red marker that says "DANGER."

Enjoy your crown this week, Roy. You earned it. But remember: you're 12-8, still in third place, and still one bad week away from everyone remembering you're just another pretender with a good week. **This Year FC** better become **This Week FC** because that's all you've got right now. 👑

## 💀 Peter "Peattle Pounders" Henze — 53 pts

Peter, FIFTY-THREE POINTS. What kind of **black magic witchcraft** did you perform this week? Did you sacrifice a goat? Make a deal with the devil? Finally read the rules? You beat Kyle 53-19 in a performance so shocking it should come with a wellness check and a drug test. This wasn't just a win — this was a **public execution televised in 8K HDR** for maximum humiliation.

You're 11-9 now, sitting in fifth place, and you're the **monthly leader for January** with 123 points over two weeks. Read that again. Peter Henze. Monthly leader. The same Peter who spent half the season looking like he was allergic to points is now dropping 53 and making people question if the simulation is broken. You look like if **hepatitis C took a multivitamin** — still deeply concerning, but somehow slightly improved.

"Peattle Pounders"? For once you actually DID some pounding. You didn't just beat Kyle — you **destroyed** him, left him questioning his existence, and reminded everyone that even broken clocks are right twice a day. Except you've been right twice in a row now, which means either you've figured something out or the universe is playing a sick joke on all of us.

But don't get comfortable, because let's be clear: this is still Peter we're talking about. You look like you **smell like hot dog water mixed with success** — that weird combination of triumph and tragedy that makes people wonder if they should congratulate you or call social services. Your team name should be "Peattle Finally Did Something," because that's the headline everyone's reading right now.

Fifty-three points is world-class. It's dominant. It's the kind of score that makes people respect you, even if they don't want to. You're proving that being terrible isn't permanent — it's just your default setting until you remember you're actually supposed to be playing football. Enjoy your moment, Peter. You've earned it, even if we're all still confused about how it happened. 🎯

## 💀 chris "Schrödongers" duncam — 46 pts

Chris, you didn't just win — you **exposed the fraud king**. Forty-six points and you beat Josiah 46-20 in a result so catastrophic it should be preserved in the Library of Congress under the title *How to Destroy a Man's Soul in 90 Minutes*. This wasn't just a victory — this was **public humiliation on an international stage**.

You're 10-10 now, perfectly balanced as all things should be, sitting in eighth place and proving that Schrödinger's cat is both alive and dead until someone looks at it. You look like **the 'manager' kid from Shazam if he finally figured out the magic word** — still technically questionable, but somehow functional. This week you were the magic word, the spell, and the lightning bolt all at once.

"Schrödongers"? More like Schrödinger's DOMINANCE, because this week you existed in a quantum state of "did Chris just obliterate Josiah?" and "yes, yes he absolutely did." You didn't just beat him — you **humiliated** him, exposed him, and reminded everyone that the fraud king's empire is built on sand. Twenty points. Josiah scored TWENTY POINTS. That's not a loss, that's a **war crime**.

You look like if **unenthusiastic handjob suddenly became VERY enthusiastic** — like someone flipped a switch and you went from disappointing to dominant in the span of one week. Your 10-10 record is the most Chris thing ever: perfectly mediocre, perfectly confusing, perfectly YOU. You're proving that you can be both **INCREDIBLY GOOD** (GW20: 46 pts) and **INCREDIBLY MID** (your entire existence) at the same time.

But let's give credit where it's due: you just beat the fraud king by 26 points. That's not a victory — that's a **public execution with receipts**. Enjoy your W, Chris. You've reminded everyone that even broken slot machines pay out sometimes, and when they do, they pay out BIG. 💥

---

## 💀 Noah "Trophies Matter FC" Wilson — 42 pts

Noah, forty-two points and you beat Sean 42-30. That's not impressive — that's **expected**. You're 10-1-9 now, sitting in seventh place, and you're proving that trophies don't matter, consistency doesn't matter, and neither does your team name because it's all a lie. You look like **Bruno Mars if he gave up on music and started a podcast about cryptocurrency** — technically doing something, but nobody's quite sure what.

"Trophies Matter"? Bro, the only thing that matters is that you beat Sean, which is like beating a participation trophy in a race where everyone gets a participation trophy. You're not special. You're not elite. You're just... there, floating in the middle of the league like a **cosmic anomaly** that nobody knows how to deal with. You look like **Pocahontas who discovered DoorDash** — still technically a person, but something's deeply off about you.

Your team is the kind of roster people put together when they forget about lineup locks and just hope for the best. Every week you manage to scrape together enough points to look competent, except this week you actually WERE competent, which is somehow more confusing than when you're terrible. You have the expression of someone who **just discovered fire but isn't quite sure what to do with it** — proud, confused, and slightly concerned about what happens next.

Still, forty-two points is solid. It's respectable. It's the kind of score that makes people nod and say "good job" without actually meaning it. You're proving that being average is your superpower, your identity, and the only thing people will remember about you long after you've quit the league in shame. Frame it. Tattoo it across your chest. Because next week you'll be back to being everyone's free points generator and this will all be a distant memory. 📊

---

## 💀 Don "son4lyfe" Kim — 40 pts

Don, FORTY POINTS and you beat Harry 40-27. That's not a win — that's a **miracle wrapped in confusion and served with a side of "how did this happen?"** You're 9-11 now, sitting in ninth place, and you're proving that Son would probably file a **restraining order AND a cease and desist** if he knew you existed. You look like **Fat Damon if he discovered intermittent fasting but gave up after two days** — technically trying, but still fundamentally flawed.

"son4lyfe"? More like **mediocre4lyfe**, because that's what you are — the eternal bridesmaid, the also-ran, the guy who shows up to the party with expensive wine but still gets ignored because his personality is about as exciting as watching paint dry. You beat Harry by 13 points, which is like **dunking on a one-foot rim** — technically impressive until you realize the rim was on the ground the whole time.

Your 9-11 record is the perfect metaphor for your life: not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... there, floating in the middle of the pack like a **participation trophy that gained sentience** and decided to play fantasy football. You look like **Joe Lo Truglio's son who actually got therapy** — still questionable, but slightly improved.

But let's give credit where it's due: you beat Harry. That's something. It's not much, but it's something. You're proving that even broken clocks are right twice a day, and today you were that broken clock that somehow pointed to "victory" instead of "disappointment." Enjoy your W, Don. Next week you'll be back to being everyone's guaranteed three points and this will all be a distant memory. ⏰

---

## 💀 Ronangel "Atlético SeaSlug" Rojas — 39 pts

Ron, thirty-nine points and you lost to Roy 39-56. That's not a loss — that's a **public execution televised on every major network simultaneously**. You're 11-9 now, sitting in fourth place, and you're still the human embodiment of **damp moss growing on a tombstone in a cemetery nobody visits**. You look like **a lesbian Velma Dinkley who gave up on solving mysteries and started a blog about astrology** — technically doing something, but nobody cares.

"Atlético SeaSlug" is the most accurate name in the league: slow, slimy, and only ever relevant when someone accidentally steps on you and feels bad about it afterwards. Except this week Roy didn't feel bad — he **stomped** on you, left a mark, and kept walking while you questioned every life choice that led to this moment. You lost by 17 points, which is like losing a **race to a turtle who's also running backwards** — technically you moved, but in the wrong direction.

Your 11-9 record is somehow keeping you in fourth place, which is the most Ron thing ever. You're like a bad smell in an elevator that nobody wants to acknowledge but everyone knows is there. Every time you manage to scrape 39 points, the entire league side-eyes the calendar like, "Who got cursed this week?" and then realizes it's just Ron being Ron, which is somehow worse than a curse.

Your attack is about as threatening as a group hug at a retirement home. Your midfield could be replaced by traffic cones, and the traffic cones would file a grievance about being compared to you. Your defense oscillates between "mildly competent" and "furniture from IKEA that was assembled wrong." Watching your team is like watching a snail try to escape a salt circle: slow, painful, and guaranteed to end in tragedy.

**Enjoy the slime trail, Ron. You're 11-9, still in fourth place, and the only thing slower than your team's scoring is your acceptance that you'll never be elite. 🐌**

---

## 💀 Zryan "FootAndBallFetish" Bhao — 36 pts

Zryan, THIRTY-SIX POINTS and you beat Andrew 36-31. Wait. WAIT. **WHAT?** You... WON? You beat Andrew? Andrew "I'm supposed to be good at this" Smith? This isn't a win — this is a **glitch in the matrix**, a **cosmic accident**, a **clerical error** that should be investigated by international authorities. Someone check if the simulation is broken because Zryan Bhao just won a match.

You're 6-14 now, which means you've been everyone's free points generator for so long you should start charging rent, except nobody would pay because even your WINS are confusing. You look like if **Wolverine's super power was disappointing everyone** — like someone tried to make a superhero but accidentally used sadness as the main ingredient, leaving you with an aura that makes people question if they should laugh or cry.

"FootAndBallFetish"? Bro, the only fetish you have is for **miraculous victories that make no sense**, because that's what this is. You beat Andrew by 5 points in a result so shocking it should come with a wellness check, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers in crisis. Thirty-six points is what most people get when they **actively try to lose**, but you got it and WON, which is the most Zryan thing ever.

You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault AND you somehow used it to win** — like you're a walking genetic disaster that somehow figured out how to be functional for exactly one week. Your 6-14 record is still catastrophic, you're still in 12th place, and you're still terrible, but for ONE WEEK you were less terrible than Andrew, and that's... something?

You're not a manager, you're a **probability experiment gone wrong**. You're the fantasy equivalent of a lottery ticket that somehow paid out when it should've been thrown in the trash. Everyone circles you on the schedule expecting a free win, and this week Andrew got served a big slice of humble pie with a side of "how did I lose to ZRYAN?" 🎰

---

## 💀 Andrew "Cunha Get Me Points" Smith — 31 pts

Andrew, thirty-one points and you lost to Zryan. **ZRYAN**. Let me repeat that for the people in the back: you lost to ZRYAN BHAO. The same Zryan who's been everyone's free points generator for 19 weeks. The same Zryan who looks like disappointment took human form. You didn't just lose — you **set a new standard for embarrassment**.

You're 10-2-8 now, sitting in sixth place, and you're still the league's permanent almost-contender. You look like **Thin Diesel if he skipped leg day for a decade** — technically a person, but something's deeply off about you. You're the guy who brings the expensive wine to the party but still gets outshone by someone showing up with a six-pack and a winning personality.

"Cunha Get Me Points"? More like **Cunha Get Me Some Dignity**, because you just lost to the league's designated punching bag. Thirty-one points is what I get when I **let my dog pick my lineup**, except my dog would've at least had the self-respect not to lose to Zryan. You have the expression of an **aging performer who just realized he peaked in high school** — desperate, confused, and somehow still trying to convince everyone he's relevant.

This wasn't just a loss. This was a **career-defining moment** in the worst way possible. You're proving that being good on paper means absolutely nothing when you can't execute when it matters. Your team looks sharp, your squad has depth, but you still found a way to lose to ZRYAN, which should be physically impossible according to the laws of fantasy football.

You're 10-2-8 and still in sixth place, which is the most Andrew thing ever. Not bad enough to be pitied, not good enough to be respected, just... there, floating in mediocrity while the rest of us question how you managed to lose to the one person in the league who shouldn't be able to beat anyone. Frame this L. Tattoo it across your chest. Because it's the only thing people will remember about your season. 💔

## 💀 Sean "Gweepy" Dunn — 30 pts

Sean, thirty points and you lost to Noah 30-42. That's not a loss — that's **expected**. You're 12-8 now, sitting in SECOND PLACE, and nobody believes you belong there because you just dropped 30 points like it was an achievement. You look like a **dollar store Ken doll that melted in the sun** — technically recognizable, but something's deeply wrong with the face.

"Gweepy" is the noise a **cartoon character makes when they realize they're terrible at their job**, and that's you every single week. Last week you were competent. This week you're back to being Sean, which means you're back to being the guy who can drop 63 one week and 30 the next without any explanation for why this happens. You're proving that consistency is a myth and you're the living proof.

Your 12-8 record is somehow keeping you in second place, which is the most confusing thing about this league. You look like you have **more DNA in your mouth than ancestry.com's vault AND you used it all for nothing** — like you're a walking genetic experiment that forgot the point of the experiment halfway through. You have the expression of someone who **just discovered they're allergic to success** — proud when it happens, confused when it doesn't, and completely unable to explain either outcome.

Still, you're in second place. That means something, even if nobody's quite sure what. You're proving that in a league of chaos, being chaotically decent is good enough to stay near the top. You lost to Noah by 12 points, which is like losing a **race to someone who's also not trying** — technically you both finished, but neither of you should be proud.

Enjoy second place, Sean. You've earned it through sheer luck, cosmic confusion, and the fact that everyone else is too busy being terrible to notice you're also terrible. 📉

---

## 💀 Harry "cunha believe it" Liu — 27 pts

Harry, twenty-seven points and you lost to Don 27-40. That's not a loss — that's a **continuation of your miserable existence**. You're 6-1-13 now, sitting in 11th place, and your goal difference is **-158**, which is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an experimental art piece titled *What If Losing Was My Entire Personality*.

You look like **Matt Damon if he found the cookie jar AND the entire bakery** — technically a person, but something's deeply, fundamentally wrong with you. Your season has been a highlight reel of self-inflicted wounds, catastrophic decisions, and moments that make people question if you've ever actually watched football before. Twenty-seven points is what I get when I **sleep through lineup lock AND my phone dies AND the power goes out**.

"cunha believe it"? No, Harry. We can't. We can't believe you're still playing. We can't believe you scored 27 points. We can't believe you lost to Don by 13 points. We can't believe you're 6-1-13. We can't believe ANYTHING about your season because it's all so tragically, beautifully terrible. You have a face so boring that people have to stare at the white wall behind you for some amusement, and that wall is more interesting than your team.

You look like you have an **800-page manifesto** somewhere explaining why you're actually good at this, except the manifesto is just 800 pages of you crying and blaming the universe for your incompetence. You're not a manager — you're a **cautionary tale**, a **warning label**, a **public service announcement** about what happens when someone plays fantasy football while actively trying to lose.

Your 6-1-13 record is so bad it's impressive. You're proving that being terrible isn't just a phase — it's a lifestyle, a calling, your entire identity. You lost to Don by 13 points, which is like losing a **race to someone who's also running in the wrong direction** — technically you both moved, but you moved MORE in the wrong direction.

**Enjoy 11th place, Harry. You've earned it through hard work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to being the league's punchline. 🤡**

---

## 💀 Josiah "thenotsospecialone" Loh — 20 pts

Josiah. **TWENTY POINTS**. Not twenty-one. Not twenty-five. TWENTY. You didn't just lose — you got **absolutely obliterated**, **publicly humiliated**, **exposed for the fraud you are** in front of the entire league while we all watched with popcorn and schadenfreude. Chris beat you 46-20 in a performance so catastrophic it should be taught in business schools as a case study on "How to Destroy Your Reputation in One Week."

You're 13-7 now, STILL in first place, but everyone knows you're an empty husk floating on luck's tide like driftwood nobody wants to pick up. You look like **Post Malone's discount cousin, Post Alone, who just got dumped via text** — technically still functioning, but something's died inside. Twenty points. TWENTY. That's not a score, that's a **cry for help**, a **public breakdown**, a **mental health emergency** disguised as fantasy football.

"thenotsospecialone"? More like **thenotsocompetentone**, because that's what you are — a fraud king whose empire is crumbling faster than a sandcastle at high tide. You don't *win* games, you *outlast* people like a cockroach outlasts a nuclear apocalypse — ugly, hard to kill, and somehow still here even though everyone wishes you'd disappear. You look like you **smell like hot dog water mixed with desperation** — that weird, greasy, slightly-off smell that makes people question every life choice that led them to this moment.

But here's the truth, Josiah: the league knows. We ALL know. You're not elite. You're not dominant. You're just lucky, and this week your luck ran out faster than your dignity. Twenty points is what people get when they **forget to set their lineup AND their cat dies AND the app crashes**. You got twenty points while TRYING, which is somehow infinitely worse.

You have the expression of an **aging performer who just realized the show's been canceled** — desperate, confused, and frantically trying to convince everyone this is just a temporary setback. But it's not. This is who you are. This is your reality. You're the fraud king, the emperor with no clothes, the wizard behind the curtain, and Chris just pulled back that curtain and exposed you for the world to see.

You're still in first place, which is the only thing saving you from complete humiliation. But that lead is shrinking faster than your credibility, and everyone's circling like sharks who smell blood in the water. **THE FRAUD KING HAS BEEN EXPOSED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME IT'S EVEN BETTER. 💀**

---

## 💀 Kyle "Extended Foreplay" Herrera — 19 pts

Kyle, NINETEEN POINTS. That's not a score — that's a **mathematical impossibility**, a **clerical error**, a **glitch in the simulation** that should be investigated by international authorities. You lost to Peter 19-53 in a performance so catastrophic it should come with a warning label, a therapist on speed dial, and a hotline for managers in crisis.

You're 8-12 now, sitting in 10th place, and you're proving that "Extended Foreplay" is the perfect name because your team exists in a quantum state where it's simultaneously terrible and MORE terrible until someone actually looks at it. You look like if **Khal Drogo took 6 inches off his height, added it to his waistline, AND forgot how to be a warrior** — like someone ordered a "badass" from Wish.com and received a "bad ass" instead.

"Extended Foreplay"? More like **Extended Suffering**, because that's what watching your team is — an exercise in patience, disappointment, and questioning why we all agreed to be in a league with you. Nineteen points is what I get when I **actively try to lose AND succeed spectacularly**. You didn't just lose to Peter — you lost to Peter by THIRTY-FOUR POINTS, which is like losing a **race to a sloth who's also taking a nap**.

You look like **Otis from sex education if he gave up on sex education and started a podcast about failure** — technically doing something, but nobody's listening and nobody cares. Your 8-12 record is so catastrophic it looks like you're running an **experimental art piece** titled *What If Losing Was Performance Art and I Was the Method Actor*, except you're so committed to the role you forgot it's supposed to be art.

You lost to Peter by 34 points. PETER. The same Peter who spent half the season looking like he was allergic to points. You made Peter look ELITE, which should be physically impossible according to the laws of fantasy football. This wasn't just a loss — this was a **career-defining moment** in the worst way possible.

**Enjoy 10th place, Kyle. You've earned it through hard work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to being terrible when it matters most. 🎪**

# 🎤 Final Curtain — GW20

GW20 was a **massacre disguised as fantasy football**. Roy remembered he's supposed to be elite and dropped 56 points like it was nothing. Peter crawled out of the basement with 53 points and made everyone question if the simulation is broken. Chris exposed Josiah for the fraud he is with a dominant 46-point performance. Noah beat Sean because of course he did, Don beat Harry because Harry is cursed, and Ron got stomped by Roy because that's what slugs deserve.

But the REAL stories? **Josiah scored TWENTY POINTS** and got exposed for the fraud king he is. **Zryan beat Andrew** in a result so shocking it should come with a wellness check. **Kyle scored NINETEEN POINTS** and made Peter look like a fantasy god. The chaos is real, the league is broken, and nobody is safe.

**Top 3:** Roy (56) committed murder on live television, Peter (53) discovered he's not completely useless, and Chris (46) exposed the fraud king while we all watched with popcorn.

**Bottom 3:** Josiah (20) got publicly humiliated and exposed, Harry (27) continued his miserable existence, and Kyle (19) made everyone question if he knows what fantasy football is.

Week 20 made one thing clear: this league is pure chaos, Josiah's crown is made of cardboard, and Peter might actually be good now. **Nobody is safe. Not even the fraud king. 💀**
